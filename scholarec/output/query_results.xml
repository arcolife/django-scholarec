    <title>Maximizing profit using recommender systems</title>
    <summary>  Traditional recommendation systems make recommendations based solely on the
customer's past purchases, product ratings and demographic data without
considering the profitability the items being recommended. In this work we
study the question of how a vendor can directly incorporate the profitability
of items into its recommender so as to maximize its expected profit while still
providing accurate recommendations. Our approach uses the output of any
traditional recommender system and adjust them according to item
profitabilities. Our approach is parameterized so the vendor can control how
much the recommendation incorporating profits can deviate from the traditional
recommendation. We study our approach under two settings and show that it
achieves approximately 22% more profit than traditional recommendations.

    <title>The Universal Recommender</title>
    <summary>  We describe the Universal Recommender, a recommender system for semantic
datasets that generalizes domain-specific recommenders such as content-based,
collaborative, social, bibliographic, lexicographic, hybrid and other
recommenders. In contrast to existing recommender systems, the Universal
Recommender applies to any dataset that allows a semantic representation. We
describe the scalable three-stage architecture of the Universal Recommender and
its application to Internet Protocol Television (IPTV). To achieve good
recommendation accuracy, several novel machine learning and optimization
problems are identified. We finally give a brief argument supporting the need
for machine learning recommenders.

    <title>Food Recommendation using Ontology and Heuristics</title>
    <summary>  Recommender systems are needed to find food items of ones interest. We review
recommender systems and recommendation methods. We propose a food
personalization framework based on adaptive hypermedia. We extend Hermes
framework with food recommendation functionality. We combine TF-IDF term
extraction method with cosine similarity measure. Healthy heuristics and
standard food database are incorporated into the knowledgebase. Based on the
performed evaluation, we conclude that semantic recommender systems in general
outperform traditional recommenders systems with respect to accuracy,
precision, and recall, and that the proposed recommender has a better F-measure
than existing semantic recommenders.

    <title>Estimating Probabilities in Recommendation Systems</title>
    <summary>  Recommendation systems are emerging as an important business application with
significant economic impact. Currently popular systems include Amazon's book
recommendations, Netflix's movie recommendations, and Pandora's music
recommendations. In this paper we address the problem of estimating
probabilities associated with recommendation system data using non-parametric
kernel smoothing. In our estimation we interpret missing items as randomly
censored observations and obtain efficient computation schemes using
combinatorial properties of generating functions. We demonstrate our approach
with several case studies involving real world movie recommendation data. The
results are comparable with state-of-the-art techniques while also providing
probabilistic preference estimates outside the scope of traditional recommender
systems.

    <title>Usage-based vs. Citation-based Methods for Recommending Scholarly
  Research Articles</title>
    <summary>  There are two principal data sources for collaborative filtering recommenders
in scholarly digital libraries: usage data obtained from harvesting a large,
distributed collection of Open URL web logs and citation data obtained from the
journal articles. This study explores the characteristics of recommendations
generated by implementations of these two methods: the 'bX' system by ExLibris
and an experimental citation-based recommender, Sarkanto. Recommendations from
each system were compared according to their semantic similarity to the seed
article that was used to generate them. Since the full text of the articles was
not available for all the recommendations in both systems, the semantic
similarity between the seed article and the recommended articles was deemed to
be the semantic distance between the journals in which the articles were
published. The semantic distance between journals was computed from the
"semantic vectors" distance between all the terms in the full-text of the
available articles in that journal and this study shows that citation-based
recommendations are more semantically diverse than usage-based ones. These
recommenders are complementary since most of the time, when one recommender
produces recommendations the other does not.

    <title>A Survey Paper on Recommender Systems</title>
    <summary>  Recommender systems apply data mining techniques and prediction algorithms to
predict users' interest on information, products and services among the
tremendous amount of available items. The vast growth of information on the
Internet as well as number of visitors to websites add some key challenges to
recommender systems. These are: producing accurate recommendation, handling
many recommendations efficiently and coping with the vast growth of number of
participants in the system. Therefore, new recommender system technologies are
needed that can quickly produce high quality recommendations even for huge data
sets.
  To address these issues we have explored several collaborative filtering
techniques such as the item based approach, which identify relationship between
items and indirectly compute recommendations for users based on these
relationships. The user based approach was also studied, it identifies
relationships between users of similar tastes and computes recommendations
based on these relationships.
  In this paper, we introduce the topic of recommender system. It provides ways
to evaluate e?ciency, scalability and accuracy of recommender system. The paper
also analyzes different algorithms of user based and item based techniques for
recommendation generation. Moreover, a simple experiment was conducted using a
data mining application -Weka- to apply data mining algorithms to recommender
system. We conclude by proposing our approach that might enhance the quality of
recommender systems.

    <title>A Distributed Method for Trust-Aware Recommendation in Social Networks</title>
    <summary>  This paper contains the details of a distributed trust-aware recommendation
system. Trust-base recommenders have received a lot of attention recently. The
main aim of trust-based recommendation is to deal the problems in traditional
Collaborative Filtering recommenders. These problems include cold start users,
vulnerability to attacks, etc.. Our proposed method is a distributed approach
and can be easily deployed on social networks or real life networks such as
sensor networks or peer to peer networks.

    <title>BPRS: Belief Propagation Based Iterative Recommender System</title>
    <summary>  In this paper we introduce the first application of the Belief Propagation
(BP) algorithm in the design of recommender systems. We formulate the
recommendation problem as an inference problem and aim to compute the marginal
probability distributions of the variables which represent the ratings to be
predicted. However, computing these marginal probability functions is
computationally prohibitive for large-scale systems. Therefore, we utilize the
BP algorithm to efficiently compute these functions. Recommendations for each
active user are then iteratively computed by probabilistic message passing. As
opposed to the previous recommender algorithms, BPRS does not require solving
the recommendation problem for all the users if it wishes to update the
recommendations for only a single active. Further, BPRS computes the
recommendations for each user with linear complexity and without requiring a
training period. Via computer simulations (using the 100K MovieLens dataset),
we verify that BPRS iteratively reduces the error in the predicted ratings of
the users until it converges. Finally, we confirm that BPRS is comparable to
the state of art methods such as Correlation-based neighborhood model (CorNgbr)
and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) in terms of rating and precision
accuracy. Therefore, we believe that the BP-based recommendation algorithm is a
new promising approach which offers a significant advantage on scalability
while providing competitive accuracy for the recommender systems.

    <title>Exploration in Interactive Personalized Music Recommendation: A
  Reinforcement Learning Approach</title>
    <summary>  Current music recommender systems typically act in a greedy fashion by
recommending songs with the highest user ratings. Greedy recommendation,
however, is suboptimal over the long term: it does not actively gather
information on user preferences and fails to recommend novel songs that are
potentially interesting. A successful recommender system must balance the needs
to explore user preferences and to exploit this information for recommendation.
This paper presents a new approach to music recommendation by formulating this
exploration-exploitation trade-off as a reinforcement learning task called the
multi-armed bandit. To learn user preferences, it uses a Bayesian model, which
accounts for both audio content and the novelty of recommendations. A
piecewise-linear approximation to the model and a variational inference
algorithm are employed to speed up Bayesian inference. One additional benefit
of our approach is a single unified model for both music recommendation and
playlist generation. Both simulation results and a user study indicate strong
potential for the new approach.

    <title>An MDP-based Recommender System</title>
    <summary>  Typical Recommender systems adopt a static view of the recommendation process
and treat it as a prediction problem. We argue that it is more appropriate to
view the problem of generating recommendations as a sequential decision problem
and, consequently, that Markov decision processes (MDP) provide a more
appropriate model for Recommender systems. MDPs introduce two benefits: they
take into account the long-term effects of each recommendation, and they take
into account the expected value of each recommendation. To succeed in practice,
an MDP-based Recommender system must employ a strong initial model; and the
bulk of this paper is concerned with the generation of such a model. In
particular, we suggest the use of an n-gram predictive model for generating the
initial MDP. Our n-gram model induces a Markov-chain model of user behavior
whose predictive accuracy is greater than that of existing predictive models.
We describe our predictive model in detail and evaluate its performance on real
data. In addition, we show how the model can be used in an MDP-based
Recommender system.

    <title>Collaborative Personalized Web Recommender System using Entropy based
  Similarity Measure</title>
    <summary>  On the internet, web surfers, in the search of information, always strive for
recommendations. The solutions for generating recommendations become more
difficult because of exponential increase in information domain day by day. In
this paper, we have calculated entropy based similarity between users to
achieve solution for scalability problem. Using this concept, we have
implemented an online user based collaborative web recommender system. In this
model based collaborative system, the user session is divided into two levels.
Entropy is calculated at both the levels. It is shown that from the set of
valuable recommenders obtained at level I; only those recommenders having lower
entropy at level II than entropy at level I, served as trustworthy
recommenders. Finally, top N recommendations are generated from such
trustworthy recommenders for an online user.

    <title>Improving an Hybrid Literary Book Recommendation System through Author
  Ranking</title>
    <summary>  Literary reading is an important activity for individuals and choosing to
read a book can be a long time commitment, making book choice an important task
for book lovers and public library users. In this paper we present an hybrid
recommendation system to help readers decide which book to read next. We study
book and author recommendation in an hybrid recommendation setting and test our
approach in the LitRec data set. Our hybrid book recommendation approach
purposed combines two item-based collaborative filtering algorithms to predict
books and authors that the user will like. Author predictions are expanded in
to a book list that is subsequently aggregated with the former list generated
through the initial collaborative recommender. Finally, the resulting book list
is used to yield the top-n book recommendations. By means of various
experiments, we demonstrate that author recommendation can improve overall book
recommendation.

    <title>Offering A Product Recommendation System in E-commerce</title>
    <summary>  This paper proposes a number of explicit and implicit ratings in product
recommendation system for Business-to-customer e-commerce purposes. The system
recommends the products to a new user. It depends on the purchase pattern of
previous users whose purchase pattern is close to that of a user who asks for a
recommendation. The system is based on weighted cosine similarity measure to
find out the closest user profile among the profiles of all users in database.
It also implements Association rule mining rule in recommending the products.
Also, this product recommendation system takes into consideration the time of
transaction of purchasing the items, thus eliminating sequence recognition
problem. Experimental result shows for implicit rating, the proposed method
gives acceptable performance in recommending the products. It also shows
introduction of association rule improves the performance measure of
recommendation system.

    <title>Improving tag recommendation by folding in more consistency</title>
    <summary>  Tag recommendation is a major aspect of collaborative tagging systems. It
aims to recommend tags to a user for tagging an item. In this paper we present
a part of our work in progress which is a novel improvement of recommendations
by re-ranking the output of a tag recommender. We mine association rules
between candidates tags in order to determine a more consistent list of tags to
recommend.
  Our method is an add-on one which leads to better recommendations as we show
in this paper. It is easily parallelizable and morever it may be applied to a
lot of tag recommenders. The experiments we did on five datasets with two kinds
of tag recommender demonstrated the efficiency of our method.

    <title>Recommender systems in industrial contexts</title>
    <summary>  This thesis consists of four parts: - An analysis of the core functions and
the prerequisites for recommender systems in an industrial context: we identify
four core functions for recommendation systems: Help do Decide, Help to
Compare, Help to Explore, Help to Discover. The implementation of these
functions has implications for the choices at the heart of algorithmic
recommender systems. - A state of the art, which deals with the main techniques
used in automated recommendation system: the two most commonly used algorithmic
methods, the K-Nearest-Neighbor methods (KNN) and the fast factorization
methods are detailed. The state of the art presents also purely content-based
methods, hybridization techniques, and the classical performance metrics used
to evaluate the recommender systems. This state of the art then gives an
overview of several systems, both from academia and industry (Amazon, Google
...). - An analysis of the performances and implications of a recommendation
system developed during this thesis: this system, Reperio, is a hybrid
recommender engine using KNN methods. We study the performance of the KNN
methods, including the impact of similarity functions used. Then we study the
performance of the KNN method in critical uses cases in cold start situation. -
A methodology for analyzing the performance of recommender systems in
industrial context: this methodology assesses the added value of algorithmic
strategies and recommendation systems according to its core functions.

    <title>A two-step model and the algorithm for recalling in recommender systems</title>
    <summary>  When a user finds an interesting recommendation in a recommender system, the
user may want to recall related items recommended in the past to reconsider or
to enjoy them again. If the system can pick up such "recalled" items at each
user's request, it must deepen the user experience.
  We propose a model and the algorithm for such personalized "recalling" in
conventional recommender systems, which is an application of neural networks
for associative memory. In our model, the "recalled" items can reflect each
user's personality beyond naive similarities between items.

    <title>Improving information filtering via network manipulation</title>
    <summary>  Recommender system is a very promising way to address the problem of
overabundant information for online users. Though the information filtering for
the online commercial systems received much attention recently, almost all of
the previous works are dedicated to design new algorithms and consider the
user-item bipartite networks as given and constant information. However, many
problems for recommender systems such as the cold-start problem (i.e. low
recommendation accuracy for the small degree items) are actually due to the
limitation of the underlying user-item bipartite networks. In this letter, we
propose a strategy to enhance the performance of the already existing
recommendation algorithms by directly manipulating the user-item bipartite
networks, namely adding some virtual connections to the networks. Numerical
analyses on two benchmark data sets, MovieLens and Netflix, show that our
method can remarkably improve the recommendation performance. Specifically, it
not only improve the recommendations accuracy (especially for the small degree
items), but also help the recommender systems generate more diverse and novel
recommendations.

    <title>Personalized News Recommendation with Context Trees</title>
    <summary>  The profusion of online news articles makes it difficult to find interesting
articles, a problem that can be assuaged by using a recommender system to bring
the most relevant news stories to readers. However, news recommendation is
challenging because the most relevant articles are often new content seen by
few users. In addition, they are subject to trends and preference changes over
time, and in many cases we do not have sufficient information to profile the
reader.
  In this paper, we introduce a class of news recommendation systems based on
context trees. They can provide high-quality news recommendation to anonymous
visitors based on present browsing behaviour. We show that context-tree
recommender systems provide good prediction accuracy and recommendation
novelty, and they are sufficiently flexible to capture the unique properties of
news articles.

    <title>Content-Based Book Recommending Using Learning for Text Categorization</title>
    <summary>  Recommender systems improve access to relevant products and information by
making personalized suggestions based on previous examples of a user's likes
and dislikes. Most existing recommender systems use social filtering methods
that base recommendations on other users' preferences. By contrast,
content-based methods use information about an item itself to make suggestions.
This approach has the advantage of being able to recommended previously unrated
items to users with unique interests and to provide explanations for its
recommendations. We describe a content-based book recommending system that
utilizes information extraction and a machine-learning algorithm for text
categorization. Initial experimental results demonstrate that this approach can
produce accurate recommendations.

    <title>Performing Hybrid Recommendation in Intermodal Transportation-the
  FTMarket System's Recommendation Module</title>
    <summary>  Diverse recommendation techniques have been already proposed and encapsulated
into several e-business applications, aiming to perform a more accurate
evaluation of the existing information and accordingly augment the assistance
provided to the users involved. This paper reports on the development and
integration of a recommendation module in an agent-based transportation
transactions management system. The module is built according to a novel hybrid
recommendation technique, which combines the advantages of collaborative
filtering and knowledge-based approaches. The proposed technique and supporting
module assist customers in considering in detail alternative transportation
transactions that satisfy their requests, as well as in evaluating completed
transactions. The related services are invoked through a software agent that
constructs the appropriate knowledge rules and performs a synthesis of the
recommendation policy.

    <title>A multidimensional approach for context-aware recommendation in mobile
  commerce</title>
    <summary>  Context as the dynamic information describing the situation of items and
users and affecting the users decision process is essential to be used by
recommender systems in mobile commerce to guarantee the quality of
recommendation. This paper proposes a novel multidimensional approach for
context aware recommendation in mobile commerce. The approach represents users,
items, context information and the relationship between them in a
multidimensional space. It then determines the usage patterns of each user
under different contextual situations and creates a new 2 dimensional
recommendation space and does the final recommendation in that space. This
paper also represents an evaluation process by implementing the proposed
approach in a restaurant food recommendation system considering day, time,
weather and companion as the contextual information and comparing the approach
with the traditional 2 dimensional one. The results of comparison illustrates
that the multidimensional approach increases the recommendation quality.

    <title>Collaborative Competitive filtering II: Optimal Recommendation and
  Collaborative Games</title>
    <summary>  Recommender systems have emerged as a new weapon to help online firms to
realize many of their strategic goals (e.g., to improve sales, revenue,
customer experience etc.). However, many existing techniques commonly approach
these goals by seeking to recover preference (e.g., estimating ratings) in a
matrix completion framework. This paper aims to bridge this significant gap
between the clearly-defined strategic objectives and the not-so-well-justified
proxy.
  We show it is advantageous to think of a recommender system as an analogy to
a monopoly economic market with the system as the sole seller, users as the
buyers and items as the goods. This new perspective motivates a game-theoretic
formulation for recommendation that enables us to identify the optimal
recommendation policy by explicit optimizing certain strategic goals. In this
paper, we revisit and extend our prior work, the Collaborative-Competitive
Filtering preference model, towards a game-theoretic framework. The proposed
framework consists of two components. First, a conditional preference model
that characterizes how a user would respond to a recommendation action; Second,
knowing in advance how the user would respond, how a recommender system should
act (i.e., recommend) strategically to maximize its goals. We show how
objectives such as click-through rate, sales revenue and consumption diversity
can be optimized explicitly in this framework. Experiments are conducted on a
commercial recommender system and demonstrate promising results.

    <title>Semi-metric networks for recommender systems</title>
    <summary>  Weighted graphs obtained from co-occurrence in user-item relations lead to
non-metric topologies. We use this semi-metric behavior to issue
recommendations, and discuss its relationship to transitive closure on fuzzy
graphs. Finally, we test the performance of this method against other item- and
user-based recommender systems on the Movielens benchmark. We show that
including highly semi-metric edges in our recommendation algorithms leads to
better recommendations.

    <title>Content-boosted Matrix Factorization Techniques for Recommender Systems</title>
    <summary>  Many businesses are using recommender systems for marketing outreach.
Recommendation algorithms can be either based on content or driven by
collaborative filtering. We study different ways to incorporate content
information directly into the matrix factorization approach of collaborative
filtering. These content-boosted matrix factorization algorithms not only
improve recommendation accuracy, but also provide useful insights about the
contents, as well as make recommendations more easily interpretable.

    <title>Challenging the Long Tail Recommendation</title>
    <summary>  The success of "infinite-inventory" retailers such as Amazon.com and Netflix
has been largely attributed to a "long tail" phenomenon. Although the majority
of their inventory is not in high demand, these niche products, unavailable at
limited-inventory competitors, generate a significant fraction of total revenue
in aggregate. In addition, tail product availability can boost head sales by
offering consumers the convenience of "one-stop shopping" for both their
mainstream and niche tastes. However, most of existing recommender systems,
especially collaborative filter based methods, can not recommend tail products
due to the data sparsity issue. It has been widely acknowledged that to
recommend popular products is easier yet more trivial while to recommend long
tail products adds more novelty yet it is also a more challenging task. In this
paper, we propose a novel suite of graph-based algorithms for the long tail
recommendation. We first represent user-item information with undirected
edge-weighted graph and investigate the theoretical foundation of applying
Hitting Time algorithm for long tail item recommendation. To improve
recommendation diversity and accuracy, we extend Hitting Time and propose
efficient Absorbing Time algorithm to help users find their favorite long tail
items. Finally, we refine the Absorbing Time algorithm and propose two
entropy-biased Absorbing Cost algorithms to distinguish the variation on
different user-item rating pairs, which further enhances the effectiveness of
long tail recommendation. Empirical experiments on two real life datasets show
that our proposed algorithms are effective to recommend long tail items and
outperform state-of-the-art recommendation techniques.

    <title>A Connection-Centric Survey of Recommender Systems Research</title>
    <summary>  Recommender systems attempt to reduce information overload and retain
customers by selecting a subset of items from a universal set based on user
preferences. While research in recommender systems grew out of information
retrieval and filtering, the topic has steadily advanced into a legitimate and
challenging research area of its own. Recommender systems have traditionally
been studied from a content-based filtering vs. collaborative design
perspective. Recommendations, however, are not delivered within a vacuum, but
rather cast within an informal community of users and social context.
Therefore, ultimately all recommender systems make connections among people and
thus should be surveyed from such a perspective. This viewpoint is
under-emphasized in the recommender systems literature. We therefore take a
connection-oriented viewpoint toward recommender systems research. We posit
that recommendation has an inherently social element and is ultimately intended
to connect people either directly as a result of explicit user modeling or
indirectly through the discovery of relationships implicit in extant data.
Thus, recommender systems are characterized by how they model users to bring
people together: explicitly or implicitly. Finally, user modeling and the
connection-centric viewpoint raise broadening and social issues--such as
evaluation, targeting, and privacy and trust--which we also briefly address.

    <title>Exploiting Synergy Between Ontologies and Recommender Systems</title>
    <summary>  Recommender systems learn about user preferences over time, automatically
finding things of similar interest. This reduces the burden of creating
explicit queries. Recommender systems do, however, suffer from cold-start
problems where no initial information is available early on upon which to base
recommendations. Semantic knowledge structures, such as ontologies, can provide
valuable domain knowledge and user information. However, acquiring such
knowledge and keeping it up to date is not a trivial task and user interests
are particularly difficult to acquire and maintain. This paper investigates the
synergy between a web-based research paper recommender system and an ontology
containing information automatically extracted from departmental databases
available on the web. The ontology is used to address the recommender systems
cold-start problem. The recommender system addresses the ontology's
interest-acquisition problem. An empirical evaluation of this approach is
conducted and the performance of the integrated systems measured.

    <title>Clustering-Based Matrix Factorization</title>
    <summary>  Recommender systems are emerging technologies that nowadays can be found in
many applications such as Amazon, Netflix, and so on. These systems help users
to find relevant information, recommendations, and their preferred items.
Slightly improvement of the accuracy of these recommenders can highly affect
the quality of recommendations. Matrix Factorization is a popular method in
Recommendation Systems showing promising results in accuracy and complexity. In
this paper we propose an extension of matrix factorization which adds general
neighborhood information on the recommendation model. Users and items are
clustered into different categories to see how these categories share
preferences. We then employ these shared interests of categories in a fusion by
Biased Matrix Factorization to achieve more accurate recommendations. This is a
complement for the current neighborhood aware matrix factorization models which
rely on using direct neighborhood information of users and items. The proposed
model is tested on two well-known recommendation system datasets: Movielens100k
and Netflix. Our experiment shows applying the general latent features of
categories into factorized recommender models improves the accuracy of
recommendations. The current neighborhood-aware models need a great number of
neighbors to acheive good accuracies. To the best of our knowledge, the
proposed model is better than or comparable with the current neighborhood-aware
models when they consider fewer number of neighbors.

    <title>The Topology of Music Recommendation Networks</title>
    <summary>  We study the topology of several music recommendation networks, which rise
from relationships between artist, co-occurrence of songs in playlists or
experts' recommendation. The analysis uncovers the emergence of complex network
phenomena in this kind of recommendation networks, built considering artists as
nodes and their resemblance as links. We observe structural properties that
provide some hints on navigation and possible optimizations on the design of
music recommendation systems. Finally, the analysis derived from existing music
knowledge sources provides a deeper understanding of the human music similarity
perceptions.

    <title>User recommendation in reciprocal and bipartite social networks -- a
  case study of online dating</title>
    <summary>  Many social networks in our daily life are bipartite networks built on
reciprocity. How can we recommend users/friends to a user, so that the user is
interested in and attractive to recommended users? In this research, we propose
a new collaborative filtering model to improve user recommendations in
reciprocal and bipartite social networks. The model considers a user's "taste"
in picking others and "attractiveness" in being picked by others. A case study
of an online dating network shows that the new model has good performance in
recommending both initial and reciprocal contacts.

    <title>Using Contextual Information as Virtual Items on Top-N Recommender
  Systems</title>
    <summary>  Traditionally, recommender systems for the Web deal with applications that
have two dimensions, users and items. Based on access logs that relate these
dimensions, a recommendation model can be built and used to identify a set of N
items that will be of interest to a certain user. In this paper we propose a
method to complement the information in the access logs with contextual
information without changing the recommendation algorithm. The method consists
in representing context as virtual items. We empirically test this method with
two top-N recommender systems, an item-based collaborative filtering technique
and association rules, on three data sets. The results show that our method is
able to take advantage of the context (new dimensions) when it is informative.

    <title>Information filtering in sparse online systems: recommendation via
  semi-local diffusion</title>
    <summary>  With the rapid growth of the Internet and overwhelming amount of information
and choices that people are confronted with, recommender systems have been
developed to effectively support users' decision-making process in the online
systems. However, many recommendation algorithms suffer from the data sparsity
problem, i.e. the user-object bipartite networks are so sparse that algorithms
cannot accurately recommend objects for users. This data sparsity problem makes
many well-known recommendation algorithms perform poorly. To solve the problem,
we propose a recommendation algorithm based on the semi-local diffusion process
on a user-object bipartite network. The numerical simulation on two sparse
datasets, Amazon and Bookcross, show that our method significantly outperforms
the state-of-the-art methods especially for those small-degree users. Two
personalized semi-local diffusion methods are proposed which further improve
the recommendation accuracy. Finally, our work indicates that sparse online
systems are essentially different from the dense online systems, all the
algorithms and conclusions based on dense data should be rechecked again in
sparse data.

    <title>Information filtering via hybridization of similarity preferential
  diffusion processes</title>
    <summary>  The recommender system is one of the most promising ways to address the
information overload problem in online systems. Based on the personal
historical record, the recommender system can find interesting and relevant
objects for the user within a huge information space. Many physical processes
such as the mass diffusion and heat conduction have been applied to design the
recommendation algorithms. The hybridization of these two algorithms has been
shown to provide both accurate and diverse recommendation results. In this
paper, we proposed two similarity preferential diffusion processes. Extensive
experimental analyses on two benchmark data sets demonstrate that both
recommendation and accuracy and diversity are improved duet to the similarity
preference in the diffusion. The hybridization of the similarity preferential
diffusion processes is shown to significantly outperform the state-of-art
recommendation algorithm. Finally, our analysis on network sparsity show that
there is significant difference between dense and sparse system, indicating
that all the former conclusions on recommendation in the literature should be
reexamined in sparse system.

    <title>Recommender System for Online Dating Service</title>
    <summary>  Users of online dating sites are facing information overload that requires
them to manually construct queries and browse huge amount of matching user
profiles. This becomes even more problematic for multimedia profiles. Although
matchmaking is frequently cited as a typical application for recommender
systems, there is a surprising lack of work published in this area. In this
paper we describe a recommender system we implemented and perform a
quantitative comparison of two collaborative filtering (CF) and two global
algorithms. Results show that collaborative filtering recommenders
significantly outperform global algorithms that are currently used by dating
sites. A blind experiment with real users also confirmed that users prefer CF
based recommendations to global popularity recommendations. Recommender systems
show a great potential for online dating where they could improve the value of
the service to users and improve monetization of the service.

    <title>Toward a New Protocol to Evaluate Recommender Systems</title>
    <summary>  In this paper, we propose an approach to analyze the performance and the
added value of automatic recommender systems in an industrial context. We show
that recommender systems are multifaceted and can be organized around 4
structuring functions: help users to decide, help users to compare, help users
to discover, help users to explore. A global off line protocol is then proposed
to evaluate recommender systems. This protocol is based on the definition of
appropriate evaluation measures for each aforementioned function. The
evaluation protocol is discussed from the perspective of the usefulness and
trust of the recommendation. A new measure called Average Measure of Impact is
introduced. This measure evaluates the impact of the personalized
recommendation. We experiment with two classical methods, K-Nearest Neighbors
(KNN) and Matrix Factorization (MF), using the well known dataset: Netflix. A
segmentation of both users and items is proposed to finely analyze where the
algorithms perform well or badly. We show that the performance is strongly
dependent on the segments and that there is no clear correlation between the
RMSE and the quality of the recommendation.

    <title>Mathematical Modeling of Competitive Group Recommendation Systems with
  Application to Peer Review Systems</title>
    <summary>  In this paper, we present a mathematical model to capture various factors
which may influence the accuracy of a competitive group recommendation system.
We apply this model to peer review systems, i.e., conference or research grants
review, which is an essential component in our scientific community. We explore
number of important questions, i.e., how will the number of reviews per paper
affect the accuracy of the overall recommendation? Will the score aggregation
policy influence the final recommendation? How reviewers' preference may affect
the accuracy of the final recommendation? To answer these important questions,
we formally analyze our model. Through this analysis, we obtain the insight on
how to design a randomized algorithm which is both computationally efficient
and asymptotically accurate in evaluating the accuracy of a competitive group
recommendation system. We obtain number of interesting observations: i.e., for
a medium tier conference, three reviews per paper is sufficient for a high
accuracy recommendation. For prestigious conferences, one may need at least
seven reviews per paper to achieve high accuracy. We also propose a
heterogeneous review strategy which requires equal or less reviewing workload,
but can improve over a homogeneous review strategy in recommendation accuracy
by as much as 30% . We believe our models and methodology are important

    <title>Privacy Preserving Recommendation System Based on Groups</title>
    <summary>  Recommendation systems have received considerable attention in the recent
decades. Yet with the development of information technology and social media,
the risk in revealing private data to service providers has been a growing
concern to more and more users. Trade-offs between quality and privacy in
recommendation systems naturally arise. In this paper, we present a privacy
preserving recommendation framework based on groups. The main idea is to use
groups as a natural middleware to preserve users' privacy. A distributed
preference exchange algorithm is proposed to ensure the anonymity of data,
wherein the effective size of the anonymity set asymptotically approaches the
group size with time. We construct a hybrid collaborative filtering model based
on Markov random walks to provide recommendations and predictions to group
members. Experimental results on the MovieLens and Epinions datasets show that
our proposed methods outperform the baseline methods, L+ and ItemRank, two
state-of-the-art personalized recommendation algorithms, for both
recommendation precision and hit rate despite the absence of personal
preference information.

    <title>Mobile Recommender Systems Methods: An Overview</title>
    <summary>  The information that mobiles can access becomes very wide nowadays, and the
user is faced with a dilemma: there is an unlimited pool of information
available to him but he is unable to find the exact information he is looking
for. This is why the current research aims to design Recommender Systems (RS)
able to continually send information that matches the user's interests in order
to reduce his navigation time. In this paper, we treat the different approaches
to recommend.

    <title>Situation-Aware Approach to Improve Context-based Recommender System</title>
    <summary>  In this paper, we introduce a novel situation aware approach to improve a
context based recommender system. To build situation aware user profiles, we
rely on evidence issued from retrieval situations. A retrieval situation refers
to the social spatio temporal context of the user when he interacts with the
recommender system. A situation is represented as a combination of social
spatio temporal concepts inferred from ontological knowledge given social
group, location and time information. User's interests are inferred from past
user's interaction with the recommender system related to the identified
situations. They are represented using concepts issued from a domain ontology.
We also propose a method to dynamically adapt the system to the user's
interest\'\s evolution.

    <title>Adaptive model for recommendation of news</title>
    <summary>  Most news recommender systems try to identify users' interests and news'
attributes and use them to obtain recommendations. Here we propose an adaptive
model which combines similarities in users' rating patterns with epidemic-like
spreading of news on an evolving network. We study the model by computer
agent-based simulations, measure its performance and discuss its robustness
against bias and malicious behavior. Subject to the approval fraction of news
recommended, the proposed model outperforms the widely adopted recommendation
of news according to their absolute or relative popularity. This model provides
a general social mechanism for recommender systems and may find its
applications also in other types of recommendation.

    <title>Information filtering via preferential diffusion</title>
    <summary>  Recommender systems have shown great potential to address information
overload problem, namely to help users in finding interesting and relevant
objects within a huge information space. Some physical dynamics, including heat
conduction process and mass or energy diffusion on networks, have recently
found applications in personalized recommendation. Most of the previous studies
focus overwhelmingly on recommendation accuracy as the only important factor,
while overlook the significance of diversity and novelty which indeed provide
the vitality of the system. In this paper, we propose a recommendation
algorithm based on the preferential diffusion process on user-object bipartite
network. Numerical analyses on two benchmark datasets, MovieLens and Netflix,
indicate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.
Specifically, it can not only provide more accurate recommendations, but also
generate more diverse and novel recommendations by accurately recommending
unpopular objects.

    <title>Incremental Collaborative Filtering Considering Temporal Effects</title>
    <summary>  Recommender systems require their recommendation algorithms to be accurate,
scalable and should handle very sparse training data which keep changing over
time. Inspired by ant colony optimization, we propose a novel collaborative
filtering scheme: Ant Collaborative Filtering that enjoys those favorable
characteristics above mentioned. With the mechanism of pheromone transmission
between users and items, our method can pinpoint most relative users and items
even in face of the sparsity problem. By virtue of the evaporation of existing
pheromone, we capture the evolution of user preference over time. Meanwhile,
the computation complexity is comparatively small and the incremental update
can be done online. We design three experiments on three typical recommender
systems, namely movie recommendation, book recommendation and music
recommendation, which cover both explicit and implicit rating data. The results
show that the proposed algorithm is well suited for real-world recommendation
scenarios which have a high throughput and are time sensitive.

    <title>Probabilistic Models for Unified Collaborative and Content-Based
  Recommendation in Sparse-Data Environments</title>
    <summary>  Recommender systems leverage product and community information to target
products to consumers. Researchers have developed collaborative recommenders,
content-based recommenders, and (largely ad-hoc) hybrid systems. We propose a
unified probabilistic framework for merging collaborative and content-based
recommendations. We extend Hofmann's [1999] aspect model to incorporate
three-way co-occurrence data among users, items, and item content. The relative
influence of collaboration data versus content data is not imposed as an
exogenous parameter, but rather emerges naturally from the given data sources.
Global probabilistic models coupled with standard Expectation Maximization (EM)
learning algorithms tend to drastically overfit in sparse-data situations, as
is typical in recommendation applications. We show that secondary content
information can often be used to overcome sparsity. Experiments on data from
the ResearchIndex library of Computer Science publications show that
appropriate mixture models incorporating secondary data produce significantly
better quality recommenders than k-nearest neighbors (k-NN). Global
probabilistic models also allow more general inferences than local methods like
k-NN.

    <title>Do Social Explanations Work? Studying and Modeling the Effects of Social
  Explanations in Recommender Systems</title>
    <summary>  Recommender systems associated with social networks often use social
explanations (e.g. "X, Y and 2 friends like this") to support the
recommendations. We present a study of the effects of these social explanations
in a music recommendation context. We start with an experiment with 237 users,
in which we show explanations with varying levels of social information and
analyze their effect on users' decisions. We distinguish between two key
decisions: the likelihood of checking out the recommended artist, and the
actual rating of the artist based on listening to several songs. We find that
while the explanations do have some influence on the likelihood, there is
little correlation between the likelihood and actual (listening) rating for the
same artist. Based on these insights, we present a generative probabilistic
model that explains the interplay between explanations and background
information on music preferences, and how that leads to a final likelihood
rating for an artist. Acknowledging the impact of explanations, we discuss a
general recommendation framework that models external informational elements in
the recommendation interface, in addition to inherent preferences of users.

    <title>Friends, Strangers, and the Value of Ego Networks for Recommendation</title>
    <summary>  Two main approaches to using social network information in recommendation
have emerged: augmenting collaborative filtering with social data and
algorithms that use only ego-centric data. We compare the two approaches using
movie and music data from Facebook, and hashtag data from Twitter. We find that
recommendation algorithms based only on friends perform no worse than those
based on the full network, even though they require much less data and
computational resources. Further, our evidence suggests that locality of
preference, or the non-random distribution of item preferences in a social
network, is a driving force behind the value of incorporating social network
information into recommender algorithms. When locality is high, as in Twitter
data, simple k-nn recommenders do better based only on friends than they do if
they draw from the entire network. These results help us understand when, and
why, social network information is likely to support recommendation systems,
and show that systems that see ego-centric slices of a complete network (such
as websites that use Facebook logins) or have computational limitations (such
as mobile devices) may profitably use ego-centric recommendation algorithms.

    <title>Effective Personalized Recommendation in Collaborative Tagging Systems</title>
    <summary>  Recently, collaborative tagging systems have attracted more and more
attention and have been widely applied in web systems. Tags provide highly
abstracted information about personal preferences and item content, and are
therefore potential to help in improving better personalized recommendations.
In this paper, we propose a tag-based recommendation algorithm considering the
personal vocabulary and evaluate it in a real-world dataset: Del.icio.us.
Experimental results demonstrate that the usage of tag information can
significantly improve the accuracy of personalized recommendations.

    <title>The Impact of Situation Clustering in Contextual-Bandit Algorithm for
  Context-Aware Recommender Systems</title>
    <summary>  Most existing approaches in Context-Aware Recommender Systems (CRS) focus on
recommending relevant items to users taking into account contextual
information, such as time, location, or social aspects. However, few of them
have considered the problem of user's content dynamicity. We introduce in this
paper an algorithm that tackles the user's content dynamicity by modeling the
CRS as a contextual bandit algorithm and by including a situation clustering
algorithm to improve the precision of the CRS. Within a deliberately designed
offline simulation framework, we conduct evaluations with real online event log
data. The experimental results and detailed analysis reveal several important
discoveries in context aware recommender system.

    <title>A Hybrid Web Recommendation System based on the Improved Association
  Rule Mining Algorithm</title>
    <summary>  As the growing interest of web recommendation systems those are applied to
deliver customized data for their users, we started working on this system.
Generally the recommendation systems are divided into two major categories such
as collaborative recommendation system and content based recommendation system.
In case of collaborative recommen-dation systems, these try to seek out users
who share same tastes that of given user as well as recommends the websites
according to the liking given user. Whereas the content based recommendation
systems tries to recommend web sites similar to those web sites the user has
liked. In the recent research we found that the efficient technique based on
asso-ciation rule mining algorithm is proposed in order to solve the problem of
web page recommendation. Major problem of the same is that the web pages are
given equal importance. Here the importance of pages changes according to the
fre-quency of visiting the web page as well as amount of time user spends on
that page. Also recommendation of newly added web pages or the pages those are
not yet visited by users are not included in the recommendation set. To
over-come this problem, we have used the web usage log in the adaptive
association rule based web mining where the asso-ciation rules were applied to
personalization. This algorithm was purely based on the Apriori data mining
algorithm in order to generate the association rules. However this method also
suffers from some unavoidable drawbacks. In this paper we are presenting and
investigating the new approach based on weighted Association Rule Mining
Algorithm and text mining. This is improved algorithm which adds semantic
knowledge to the results, has more efficiency and hence gives better quality
and performances as compared to existing approaches.

  Peer-to-Peer Recommender Systems</title>
    <summary>  The advent of the Semantic Web necessitates paradigm shifts away from
centralized client/server architectures towards decentralization and
peer-to-peer computation, making the existence of central authorities
superfluous and even impossible. At the same time, recommender systems are
gaining considerable impact in e-commerce, providing people with
recommendations that are personalized and tailored to their very needs. These
recommender systems have traditionally been deployed with stark centralized
scenarios in mind, operating in closed communities detached from their host
network's outer perimeter. We aim at marrying these two worlds, i.e.,
decentralized peer-to-peer computing and recommender systems, in one
agent-based framework. Our architecture features an epidemic-style protocol
maintaining neighborhoods of like-minded peers in a robust, selforganizing
fashion. In order to demonstrate our architecture's ability to retain
scalability, robustness and to allow for convergence towards high-quality
recommendations, we conduct offline experiments on top of the popular MovieLens
dataset.

    <title>Discovering the Impact of Knowledge in Recommender Systems: A
  Comparative Study</title>
    <summary>  Recommender systems engage user profiles and appropriate filtering techniques
to assist users in finding more relevant information over the large volume of
information. User profiles play an important role in the success of
recommendation process since they model and represent the actual user needs.
However, a comprehensive literature review of recommender systems has
demonstrated no concrete study on the role and impact of knowledge in user
profiling and filtering approache. In this paper, we review the most prominent
recommender systems in the literature and examine the impression of knowledge
extracted from different sources. We then come up with this finding that
semantic information from the user context has substantial impact on the
performance of knowledge based recommender systems. Finally, some new clues for
improvement the knowledge-based profiles have been proposed.

    <title>Recommender Systems</title>
    <summary>  The ongoing rapid expansion of the Internet greatly increases the necessity
of effective recommender systems for filtering the abundant information.
Extensive research for recommender systems is conducted by a broad range of
communities including social and computer scientists, physicists, and
interdisciplinary researchers. Despite substantial theoretical and practical
achievements, unification and comparison of different approaches are lacking,
which impedes further advances. In this article, we review recent developments
in recommender systems and discuss the major challenges. We compare and
evaluate available algorithms and examine their roles in the future
developments. In addition to algorithms, physical aspects are described to
illustrate macroscopic behavior of recommender systems. Potential impacts and
future directions are discussed. We emphasize that recommendation has a great
scientific depth and combines diverse research fields which makes it of
interests for physicists as well as interdisciplinary researchers.

    <title>Hybrid Q-Learning Applied to Ubiquitous recommender system</title>
    <summary>  Ubiquitous information access becomes more and more important nowadays and
research is aimed at making it adapted to users. Our work consists in applying
machine learning techniques in order to bring a solution to some of the
problems concerning the acceptance of the system by users. To achieve this, we
propose a fundamental shift in terms of how we model the learning of
recommender system: inspired by models of human reasoning developed in robotic,
we combine reinforcement learning and case-base reasoning to define a
recommendation process that uses these two approaches for generating
recommendations on different context dimensions (social, temporal, geographic).
We describe an implementation of the recommender system based on this
framework. We also present preliminary results from experiments with the system
and show how our approach increases the recommendation quality.

    <title>Target tracking in the recommender space: Toward a new recommender
  system based on Kalman filtering</title>
    <summary>  In this paper, we propose a new approach for recommender systems based on
target tracking by Kalman filtering. We assume that users and their seen
resources are vectors in the multidimensional space of the categories of the
resources. Knowing this space, we propose an algorithm based on a Kalman filter
to track users and to predict the best prediction of their future position in
the recommendation space.

    <title>Crowd Avoidance and Diversity in Socio-Economic Systems and
  Recommendation</title>
    <summary>  Recommender systems recommend objects regardless of potential adverse effects
of their overcrowding. We address this shortcoming by introducing
crowd-avoiding recommendation where each object can be shared by only a limited
number of users or where object utility diminishes with the number of users
sharing it. We use real data to show that contrary to expectations, the
introduction of these constraints enhances recommendation accuracy and
diversity even in systems where overcrowding is not detrimental. The observed
accuracy improvements are explained in terms of removing potential bias of the
recommendation method. We finally propose a way to model artificial
socio-economic systems with crowd avoidance and obtain first analytical
results.

    <title>An Intelligent Multi-Agent Recommender System for Human Capacity
  Building</title>
    <summary>  This paper presents a Multi-Agent approach to the problem of recommending
training courses to engineering professionals. The recommendation system is
built as a proof of concept and limited to the electrical and mechanical
engineering disciplines. Through user modelling and data collection from a
survey, collaborative filtering recommendation is implemented using intelligent
agents. The agents work together in recommending meaningful training courses
and updating the course information. The system uses a users profile and
keywords from courses to rank courses. A ranking accuracy for courses of 90% is
achieved while flexibility is achieved using an agent that retrieves
information autonomously using data mining techniques from websites. This
manner of recommendation is scalable and adaptable. Further improvements can be
made using clustering and recording user feedback.
