And if your sole interest is to maximize the amount paid to you by\nthe seller for a sequence of recommendations, how should you recommend\noptimally if I become more inclined to ignore you with each irrelevant\nrecommendation you make? Finding an answer to these questions is a key\nchallenge in all forms of marketing that rely on and explore social ties;\nranging from personal recommendations to viral marketing.\n  In the first part of this paper, we show that there can be no pricing\nmechanism that is \"truthful\" with respect to the seller, and we use solution\nconcepts from coalitional game theory, namely the Core, the Shapley Value, and\nthe Nash Bargaining Solution, to derive provably \"fair\" prices for settings\nwith one or multiple recommenders. We then investigate pricing mechanisms for\nthe setting where recommenders have different \"purchase arguments\".

This can only be overcome when the\nrecommendee also incrementally regains trust during periods without any\nrecommendation.

We formulate the\nrecommendation problem as an inference problem and aim to compute the marginal\nprobability distributions of the variables which represent the ratings to be\npredicted. However, computing these marginal probability functions is\ncomputationally prohibitive for large-scale systems. Therefore, we utilize the\nBP algorithm to efficiently compute these functions. Recommendations for each\nactive user are then iteratively computed by probabilistic message passing. As\nopposed to the previous recommender algorithms, BPRS does not require solving\nthe recommendation problem for all the users if it wishes to update the\nrecommendations for only a single active. Further, BPRS computes the\nrecommendations for each user with linear complexity and without requiring a\ntraining period. Via computer simulations (using the 100K MovieLens dataset),\nwe verify that BPRS iteratively reduces the error in the predicted ratings of\nthe users until it converges. Finally, we confirm that BPRS is comparable to\nthe state of art methods such as Correlation-based neighborhood model (CorNgbr)\nand Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) in terms of rating and precision\naccuracy. Therefore, we believe that the BP-based recommendation algorithm is a\nnew promising approach which offers a significant advantage on scalability\nwhile providing competitive accuracy for the recommender systems.","published":"2012-09-24T16:59:12Z","updated":"2012-09-24T16:59:12Z"}],"startIndex":{"xmlns:opensearch":"http://a9.com/-/spec/opensearch/1.1/","value":"0"},"link":{"href":"http://arxiv.org/api/query?search_query%3Dall%3Arecommendation%26id_list%3D%26start%3D0%26max_results%3D10","rel":"self","type":"application/atom+xml"},"title":{"value":"ArXiv Query: search_query=all:recommendation&id_list=&start=0&max_results=10","type":"html"},"id":"http://arxiv.org/api/FCS9elUCtZk2oMUHDankqdcTz8A","itemsPerPage":{"xmlns:opensearch":"http://a9.com/-/spec/opensearch/1.1/","value":"10"},"xmlns":"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom","totalResults":{"xmlns:opensearch":"http://a9.com/-/spec/opensearch/1.1/","value":"1814"},"updated":"2014-02-06T00:00:00-05:00"}}
