    <title>The Universal Recommender</title>
    <summary>  We describe the Universal Recommender, a recommender system for semantic
datasets that generalizes domain-specific recommenders such as content-based,
collaborative, social, bibliographic, lexicographic, hybrid and other
recommenders. In contrast to existing recommender systems, the Universal
Recommender applies to any dataset that allows a semantic representation. We
describe the scalable three-stage architecture of the Universal Recommender and
its application to Internet Protocol Television (IPTV). To achieve good
recommendation accuracy, several novel machine learning and optimization
problems are identified. We finally give a brief argument supporting the need
for machine learning recommenders.

    <title>Maximizing profit using recommender systems</title>
    <summary>  Traditional recommendation systems make recommendations based solely on the
customer's past purchases, product ratings and demographic data without
considering the profitability the items being recommended. In this work we
study the question of how a vendor can directly incorporate the profitability
of items into its recommender so as to maximize its expected profit while still
providing accurate recommendations. Our approach uses the output of any
traditional recommender system and adjust them according to item
profitabilities. Our approach is parameterized so the vendor can control how
much the recommendation incorporating profits can deviate from the traditional
recommendation. We study our approach under two settings and show that it
achieves approximately 22% more profit than traditional recommendations.

    <title>Food Recommendation using Ontology and Heuristics</title>
    <summary>  Recommender systems are needed to find food items of ones interest. We review
recommender systems and recommendation methods. We propose a food
personalization framework based on adaptive hypermedia. We extend Hermes
framework with food recommendation functionality. We combine TF-IDF term
extraction method with cosine similarity measure. Healthy heuristics and
standard food database are incorporated into the knowledgebase. Based on the
performed evaluation, we conclude that semantic recommender systems in general
outperform traditional recommenders systems with respect to accuracy,
precision, and recall, and that the proposed recommender has a better F-measure
than existing semantic recommenders.

    <title>Finding the Right Set of Users: Generalized Constraints for Group
  Recommendations</title>
    <summary>  Recently, group recommendations have attracted considerable attention. Rather
than recommending items to individual users, group recommenders recommend items
to groups of users. In this position paper, we introduce the problem of forming
an appropriate group of users to recommend an item when constraints apply to
the members of the group. We present a formal model of the problem and an
algorithm for its solution. Finally, we identify several directions for future
work.

    <title>Estimating Probabilities in Recommendation Systems</title>
    <summary>  Recommendation systems are emerging as an important business application with
significant economic impact. Currently popular systems include Amazon's book
recommendations, Netflix's movie recommendations, and Pandora's music
recommendations. In this paper we address the problem of estimating
probabilities associated with recommendation system data using non-parametric
kernel smoothing. In our estimation we interpret missing items as randomly
censored observations and obtain efficient computation schemes using
combinatorial properties of generating functions. We demonstrate our approach
with several case studies involving real world movie recommendation data. The
results are comparable with state-of-the-art techniques while also providing
probabilistic preference estimates outside the scope of traditional recommender
systems.

    <title>Usage-based vs. Citation-based Methods for Recommending Scholarly
  Research Articles</title>
    <summary>  There are two principal data sources for collaborative filtering recommenders
in scholarly digital libraries: usage data obtained from harvesting a large,
distributed collection of Open URL web logs and citation data obtained from the
journal articles. This study explores the characteristics of recommendations
generated by implementations of these two methods: the 'bX' system by ExLibris
and an experimental citation-based recommender, Sarkanto. Recommendations from
each system were compared according to their semantic similarity to the seed
article that was used to generate them. Since the full text of the articles was
not available for all the recommendations in both systems, the semantic
similarity between the seed article and the recommended articles was deemed to
be the semantic distance between the journals in which the articles were
published. The semantic distance between journals was computed from the
"semantic vectors" distance between all the terms in the full-text of the
available articles in that journal and this study shows that citation-based
recommendations are more semantically diverse than usage-based ones. These
recommenders are complementary since most of the time, when one recommender
produces recommendations the other does not.

    <title>On the Pricing of Recommendations and Recommending Strategically</title>
    <summary>  If you recommend a product to me and I buy it, how much should you be paid by
the seller? And if your sole interest is to maximize the amount paid to you by
the seller for a sequence of recommendations, how should you recommend
optimally if I become more inclined to ignore you with each irrelevant
recommendation you make? Finding an answer to these questions is a key
challenge in all forms of marketing that rely on and explore social ties;
ranging from personal recommendations to viral marketing.
  In the first part of this paper, we show that there can be no pricing
mechanism that is "truthful" with respect to the seller, and we use solution
concepts from coalitional game theory, namely the Core, the Shapley Value, and
the Nash Bargaining Solution, to derive provably "fair" prices for settings
with one or multiple recommenders. We then investigate pricing mechanisms for
the setting where recommenders have different "purchase arguments". Here we
show that it might be beneficial for the recommenders to withhold some of their
arguments, unless anonymity-proof solution concepts, such as the
anonymity-proof Shapley value, are used.
  In the second part of this paper, we analyze the setting where the
recommendee loses trust in the recommender for each irrelevant recommendation.
Here we prove that even if the recommendee regains her initial trust on each
successful recommendation, the expected total profit the recommender can make
over an infinite period is bounded. This can only be overcome when the
recommendee also incrementally regains trust during periods without any
recommendation. Here, we see an interesting connection to "banner blindness",
suggesting that showing fewer ads can lead to a higher long-term profit.

    <title>A Distributed Method for Trust-Aware Recommendation in Social Networks</title>
    <summary>  This paper contains the details of a distributed trust-aware recommendation
system. Trust-base recommenders have received a lot of attention recently. The
main aim of trust-based recommendation is to deal the problems in traditional
Collaborative Filtering recommenders. These problems include cold start users,
vulnerability to attacks, etc.. Our proposed method is a distributed approach
and can be easily deployed on social networks or real life networks such as
sensor networks or peer to peer networks.

    <title>A Survey Paper on Recommender Systems</title>
    <summary>  Recommender systems apply data mining techniques and prediction algorithms to
predict users' interest on information, products and services among the
tremendous amount of available items. The vast growth of information on the
Internet as well as number of visitors to websites add some key challenges to
recommender systems. These are: producing accurate recommendation, handling
many recommendations efficiently and coping with the vast growth of number of
participants in the system. Therefore, new recommender system technologies are
needed that can quickly produce high quality recommendations even for huge data
sets.
  To address these issues we have explored several collaborative filtering
techniques such as the item based approach, which identify relationship between
items and indirectly compute recommendations for users based on these
relationships. The user based approach was also studied, it identifies
relationships between users of similar tastes and computes recommendations
based on these relationships.
  In this paper, we introduce the topic of recommender system. It provides ways
to evaluate e?ciency, scalability and accuracy of recommender system. The paper
also analyzes different algorithms of user based and item based techniques for
recommendation generation. Moreover, a simple experiment was conducted using a
data mining application -Weka- to apply data mining algorithms to recommender
system. We conclude by proposing our approach that might enhance the quality of
recommender systems.

    <title>BPRS: Belief Propagation Based Iterative Recommender System</title>
    <summary>  In this paper we introduce the first application of the Belief Propagation
(BP) algorithm in the design of recommender systems. We formulate the
recommendation problem as an inference problem and aim to compute the marginal
probability distributions of the variables which represent the ratings to be
predicted. However, computing these marginal probability functions is
computationally prohibitive for large-scale systems. Therefore, we utilize the
BP algorithm to efficiently compute these functions. Recommendations for each
active user are then iteratively computed by probabilistic message passing. As
opposed to the previous recommender algorithms, BPRS does not require solving
the recommendation problem for all the users if it wishes to update the
recommendations for only a single active. Further, BPRS computes the
recommendations for each user with linear complexity and without requiring a
training period. Via computer simulations (using the 100K MovieLens dataset),
we verify that BPRS iteratively reduces the error in the predicted ratings of
the users until it converges. Finally, we confirm that BPRS is comparable to
the state of art methods such as Correlation-based neighborhood model (CorNgbr)
and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) in terms of rating and precision
accuracy. Therefore, we believe that the BP-based recommendation algorithm is a
new promising approach which offers a significant advantage on scalability
while providing competitive accuracy for the recommender systems.
