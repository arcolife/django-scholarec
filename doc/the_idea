==============
**BASIC IDEA**
==============

- use Researchlei to get representational ideas
- Add CERN/DBLP/arXiv data
- Add recommender
- Add additional features like: 
  - Search for similar papers 
    - On the internet (google scholar/ Microsoft Academy/ Arxiv.org)
    - On social platforms (Tweets, etc)
- Add Webpage interface

========
**Data**
========

*Elasticsearch:
	- Distributed Data
	- Simplistic Views
	- Easier, faster and smarter queries 
	- DB Type: NoSQL (MongoDB: scalabale for Big Data, super-cool integration with Python)	

*Specifications:
	- Different indexes for different sources ( DBLP, arXiv, etc .. )
	- Sharding (replica of chunks)
	- An entire DB of users and their preferences available under same roof as the data.

* KimonoLabs:
	- To look for updates to datasets.
	- Deploy to dataset providing websites

============
**FrontEnd**
