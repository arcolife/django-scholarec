In this article we present the complete\none-loop Higgs boson mass matrix of the complex NMSSM in the\nrenormalisation-group improved effective potential approach. We also present\nthe trilinear Higgs boson self-couplings and the complete set of expressions\nfor various partial decay widths of a generic CP-mixed Higgs boson in the\nmodel. We then analyse a very interesting phenomenological scenario wherein the\ndecay of a relatively light pseudoscalar-like Higgs boson into ~ 125 GeV\nSM-like Higgs boson(s) is induced by non-zero CP-violating phases. We discuss\nin detail a few benchmark cases in which such a decay can contribute\nsignificantly to the production of SM-like Higgs bosons at the LHC on top of\nthe gluon fusion process. It can thus be partially responsible for the\ngamma.gamma excess near 125 GeV due to the subsequent decay of the SM-like\nHiggs boson. Such a scenario is extremely difficult to realize in the complex\nMSSM and, if probed at the LHC, it could provide an indication of the\nnon-minimal nature of supersymmetry.", "published": "2013-10-30T12:49:26Z", "title": "Novel Higgs-to-125 GeV Higgs boson decays in the complex NMSSM"}, "http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/0110340v1": {"links": [{"href": "http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/0110340v1", "type": "text/html", "rel": "alternate"}, {"href": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/hep-ph/0110340v1", "type": "application/pdf", "rel": "related", "title": "pdf"}], "author": "T.
