Einstein characterized his\nwork as a theory of principle and reasoned that beyond kinematics, the 1905\nheuristic relativity principle could offer new connections between\nnon-kinematical concepts. 2. Einstein's creativity and inventiveness and\nprocess of thinking; invention or discovery. 3. Einstein considered his best\nfriend Michele Besso as a sounding board and his class-mate from the\nPolytechnic Marcel Grossman, as his active partner. Yet, Einstein wrote to\nArnold Sommerfeld that Grossman will never claim to be considered a\nco-discoverer of the Einstein-Grossmann theory. He only helped in guiding\nEinstein through the mathematical literature, but contributed nothing of\nsubstance to the results of the theory. Hence, Einstein neither considered\nBesso or Grossmann as co-discoverers of the relativity theory which he\ninvented.\n", "title": "Albert Einstein's Methodology"}, "abs/physics/0611117v1": {"published": "2006-11-12T19:02:48Z", "authors": ["Evangelos Chaliasos"], "summary": "  As we know, from the Einstein equations the vanishing of the four-divergence\nof the energy-momentum tensor follows.
