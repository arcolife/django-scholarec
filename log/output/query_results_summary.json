{"summary":"Traditional recommendation systems make recommendations based solely on the\ncustomer's past purchases, product ratings and demographic data without\nconsidering the profitability the items being recommended. In this work we\nstudy the question of how a vendor can directly incorporate the profitability\nof items into its recommender so as to maximize its expected profit while still\nproviding accurate recommendations. Our approach uses the output of any\ntraditional recommender system and adjust them according to item\nprofitabilities. Our approach is parameterized so the vendor can control how\nmuch the recommendation incorporating profits can deviate from the traditional\nrecommendation. We study our approach under two settings and show that it\nachieves approximately 22% more profit than traditional recommendations."}
{"summary":"We describe the Universal Recommender, a recommender system for semantic\ndatasets that generalizes domain-specific recommenders such as content-based,\ncollaborative, social, bibliographic, lexicographic, hybrid and other\nrecommenders. In contrast to existing recommender systems, the Universal\nRecommender applies to any dataset that allows a semantic representation. We\ndescribe the scalable three-stage architecture of the Universal Recommender and\nits application to Internet Protocol Television (IPTV). To achieve good\nrecommendation accuracy, several novel machine learning and optimization\nproblems are identified. We finally give a brief argument supporting the need\nfor machine learning recommenders."}
{"summary":"Recommender systems are needed to find food items of ones interest. We review\nrecommender systems and recommendation methods. We propose a food\npersonalization framework based on adaptive hypermedia. We extend Hermes\nframework with food recommendation functionality. We combine TF-IDF term\nextraction method with cosine similarity measure. Healthy heuristics and\nstandard food database are incorporated into the knowledgebase. Based on the\nperformed evaluation, we conclude that semantic recommender systems in general\noutperform traditional recommenders systems with respect to accuracy,\nprecision, and recall, and that the proposed recommender has a better F-measure\nthan existing semantic recommenders."}
{"summary":"Recommendation systems are emerging as an important business application with\nsignificant economic impact. Currently popular systems include Amazon's book\nrecommendations, Netflix's movie recommendations, and Pandora's music\nrecommendations. In this paper we address the problem of estimating\nprobabilities associated with recommendation system data using non-parametric\nkernel smoothing. In our estimation we interpret missing items as randomly\ncensored observations and obtain efficient computation schemes using\ncombinatorial properties of generating functions. We demonstrate our approach\nwith several case studies involving real world movie recommendation data. The\nresults are comparable with state-of-the-art techniques while also providing\nprobabilistic preference estimates outside the scope of traditional recommender\nsystems."}
{"summary":"There are two principal data sources for collaborative filtering recommenders\nin scholarly digital libraries: usage data obtained from harvesting a large,\ndistributed collection of Open URL web logs and citation data obtained from the\njournal articles. This study explores the characteristics of recommendations\ngenerated by implementations of these two methods: the 'bX' system by ExLibris\nand an experimental citation-based recommender, Sarkanto. Recommendations from\neach system were compared according to their semantic similarity to the seed\narticle that was used to generate them. Since the full text of the articles was\nnot available for all the recommendations in both systems, the semantic\nsimilarity between the seed article and the recommended articles was deemed to\nbe the semantic distance between the journals in which the articles were\npublished. The semantic distance between journals was computed from the\n\"semantic vectors\" distance between all the terms in the full-text of the\navailable articles in that journal and this study shows that citation-based\nrecommendations are more semantically diverse than usage-based ones. These\nrecommenders are complementary since most of the time, when one recommender\nproduces recommendations the other does not."}
{"summary":"Recommender systems apply data mining techniques and prediction algorithms to\npredict users' interest on information, products and services among the\ntremendous amount of available items. The vast growth of information on the\nInternet as well as number of visitors to websites add some key challenges to\nrecommender systems. These are: producing accurate recommendation, handling\nmany recommendations efficiently and coping with the vast growth of number of\nparticipants in the system. Therefore, new recommender system technologies are\nneeded that can quickly produce high quality recommendations even for huge data\nsets.\n  To address these issues we have explored several collaborative filtering\ntechniques such as the item based approach, which identify relationship between\nitems and indirectly compute recommendations for users based on these\nrelationships. The user based approach was also studied, it identifies\nrelationships between users of similar tastes and computes recommendations\nbased on these relationships.\n  In this paper, we introduce the topic of recommender system. It provides ways\nto evaluate e?ciency, scalability and accuracy of recommender system. The paper\nalso analyzes different algorithms of user based and item based techniques for\nrecommendation generation. Moreover, a simple experiment was conducted using a\ndata mining application -Weka- to apply data mining algorithms to recommender\nsystem. We conclude by proposing our approach that might enhance the quality of\nrecommender systems."}
{"summary":"This paper contains the details of a distributed trust-aware recommendation\nsystem. Trust-base recommenders have received a lot of attention recently. The\nmain aim of trust-based recommendation is to deal the problems in traditional\nCollaborative Filtering recommenders. These problems include cold start users,\nvulnerability to attacks, etc.. Our proposed method is a distributed approach\nand can be easily deployed on social networks or real life networks such as\nsensor networks or peer to peer networks."}
{"summary":"In this paper we introduce the first application of the Belief Propagation\n(BP) algorithm in the design of recommender systems. We formulate the\nrecommendation problem as an inference problem and aim to compute the marginal\nprobability distributions of the variables which represent the ratings to be\npredicted. However, computing these marginal probability functions is\ncomputationally prohibitive for large-scale systems. Therefore, we utilize the\nBP algorithm to efficiently compute these functions. Recommendations for each\nactive user are then iteratively computed by probabilistic message passing. As\nopposed to the previous recommender algorithms, BPRS does not require solving\nthe recommendation problem for all the users if it wishes to update the\nrecommendations for only a single active. Further, BPRS computes the\nrecommendations for each user with linear complexity and without requiring a\ntraining period. Via computer simulations (using the 100K MovieLens dataset),\nwe verify that BPRS iteratively reduces the error in the predicted ratings of\nthe users until it converges. Finally, we confirm that BPRS is comparable to\nthe state of art methods such as Correlation-based neighborhood model (CorNgbr)\nand Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) in terms of rating and precision\naccuracy. Therefore, we believe that the BP-based recommendation algorithm is a\nnew promising approach which offers a significant advantage on scalability\nwhile providing competitive accuracy for the recommender systems."}
{"summary":"Current music recommender systems typically act in a greedy fashion by\nrecommending songs with the highest user ratings. Greedy recommendation,\nhowever, is suboptimal over the long term: it does not actively gather\ninformation on user preferences and fails to recommend novel songs that are\npotentially interesting. A successful recommender system must balance the needs\nto explore user preferences and to exploit this information for recommendation.\nThis paper presents a new approach to music recommendation by formulating this\nexploration-exploitation trade-off as a reinforcement learning task called the\nmulti-armed bandit. To learn user preferences, it uses a Bayesian model, which\naccounts for both audio content and the novelty of recommendations. A\npiecewise-linear approximation to the model and a variational inference\nalgorithm are employed to speed up Bayesian inference. One additional benefit\nof our approach is a single unified model for both music recommendation and\nplaylist generation. Both simulation results and a user study indicate strong\npotential for the new approach."}
{"summary":"Typical Recommender systems adopt a static view of the recommendation process\nand treat it as a prediction problem. We argue that it is more appropriate to\nview the problem of generating recommendations as a sequential decision problem\nand, consequently, that Markov decision processes (MDP) provide a more\nappropriate model for Recommender systems. MDPs introduce two benefits: they\ntake into account the long-term effects of each recommendation, and they take\ninto account the expected value of each recommendation. To succeed in practice,\nan MDP-based Recommender system must employ a strong initial model; and the\nbulk of this paper is concerned with the generation of such a model. In\nparticular, we suggest the use of an n-gram predictive model for generating the\ninitial MDP. Our n-gram model induces a Markov-chain model of user behavior\nwhose predictive accuracy is greater than that of existing predictive models.\nWe describe our predictive model in detail and evaluate its performance on real\ndata. In addition, we show how the model can be used in an MDP-based\nRecommender system."}
{"summary":"On the internet, web surfers, in the search of information, always strive for\nrecommendations. The solutions for generating recommendations become more\ndifficult because of exponential increase in information domain day by day. In\nthis paper, we have calculated entropy based similarity between users to\nachieve solution for scalability problem. Using this concept, we have\nimplemented an online user based collaborative web recommender system. In this\nmodel based collaborative system, the user session is divided into two levels.\nEntropy is calculated at both the levels. It is shown that from the set of\nvaluable recommenders obtained at level I; only those recommenders having lower\nentropy at level II than entropy at level I, served as trustworthy\nrecommenders. Finally, top N recommendations are generated from such\ntrustworthy recommenders for an online user."}
{"summary":"Literary reading is an important activity for individuals and choosing to\nread a book can be a long time commitment, making book choice an important task\nfor book lovers and public library users. In this paper we present an hybrid\nrecommendation system to help readers decide which book to read next. We study\nbook and author recommendation in an hybrid recommendation setting and test our\napproach in the LitRec data set. Our hybrid book recommendation approach\npurposed combines two item-based collaborative filtering algorithms to predict\nbooks and authors that the user will like. Author predictions are expanded in\nto a book list that is subsequently aggregated with the former list generated\nthrough the initial collaborative recommender. Finally, the resulting book list\nis used to yield the top-n book recommendations. By means of various\nexperiments, we demonstrate that author recommendation can improve overall book\nrecommendation."}
{"summary":"This paper proposes a number of explicit and implicit ratings in product\nrecommendation system for Business-to-customer e-commerce purposes. The system\nrecommends the products to a new user. It depends on the purchase pattern of\nprevious users whose purchase pattern is close to that of a user who asks for a\nrecommendation. The system is based on weighted cosine similarity measure to\nfind out the closest user profile among the profiles of all users in database.\nIt also implements Association rule mining rule in recommending the products.\nAlso, this product recommendation system takes into consideration the time of\ntransaction of purchasing the items, thus eliminating sequence recognition\nproblem.

{"summary":"This thesis consists of four parts: - An analysis of the core functions and\nthe prerequisites for recommender systems in an industrial context: we identify\nfour core functions for recommendation systems: Help do Decide, Help to\nCompare, Help to Explore, Help to Discover. The implementation of these\nfunctions has implications for the choices at the heart of algorithmic\nrecommender systems. - A state of the art, which deals with the main techniques\nused in automated recommendation system: the two most commonly used algorithmic\nmethods, the K-Nearest-Neighbor methods (KNN) and the fast factorization\nmethods are detailed.

{"summary":"When a user finds an interesting recommendation in a recommender system, the\nuser may want to recall related items recommended in the past to reconsider or\nto enjoy them again. If the system can pick up such \"recalled\" items at each\nuser's request, it must deepen the user experience.\n  We propose a model and the algorithm for such personalized \"recalling\" in\nconventional recommender systems, which is an application of neural networks\nfor associative memory. In our model, the \"recalled\" items can reflect each\nuser's personality beyond naive similarities between items."}
{"summary":"Recommender system is a very promising way to address the problem of\noverabundant information for online users. Though the information filtering for\nthe online commercial systems received much attention recently, almost all of\nthe previous works are dedicated to design new algorithms and consider the\nuser-item bipartite networks as given and constant information. However, many\nproblems for recommender systems such as the cold-start problem (i.e. low\nrecommendation accuracy for the small degree items) are actually due to the\nlimitation of the underlying user-item bipartite networks. In this letter, we\npropose a strategy to enhance the performance of the already existing\nrecommendation algorithms by directly manipulating the user-item bipartite\nnetworks, namely adding some virtual connections to the networks. Numerical\nanalyses on two benchmark data sets, MovieLens and Netflix, show that our\nmethod can remarkably improve the recommendation performance. Specifically, it\nnot only improve the recommendations accuracy (especially for the small degree\nitems), but also help the recommender systems generate more diverse and novel\nrecommendations."}
{"summary":"The profusion of online news articles makes it difficult to find interesting\narticles, a problem that can be assuaged by using a recommender system to bring\nthe most relevant news stories to readers. However, news recommendation is\nchallenging because the most relevant articles are often new content seen by\nfew users. In addition, they are subject to trends and preference changes over\ntime, and in many cases we do not have sufficient information to profile the\nreader.\n  In this paper, we introduce a class of news recommendation systems based on\ncontext trees. They can provide high-quality news recommendation to anonymous\nvisitors based on present browsing behaviour. We show that context-tree\nrecommender systems provide good prediction accuracy and recommendation\nnovelty, and they are sufficiently flexible to capture the unique properties of\nnews articles."}
{"summary":"Recommender systems improve access to relevant products and information by\nmaking personalized suggestions based on previous examples of a user's likes\nand dislikes. Most existing recommender systems use social filtering methods\nthat base recommendations on other users' preferences. By contrast,\ncontent-based methods use information about an item itself to make suggestions.\nThis approach has the advantage of being able to recommended previously unrated\nitems to users with unique interests and to provide explanations for its\nrecommendations. We describe a content-based book recommending system that\nutilizes information extraction and a machine-learning algorithm for text\ncategorization. Initial experimental results demonstrate that this approach can\nproduce accurate recommendations."}
{"summary":"Diverse recommendation techniques have been already proposed and encapsulated\ninto several e-business applications, aiming to perform a more accurate\nevaluation of the existing information and accordingly augment the assistance\nprovided to the users involved. This paper reports on the development and\nintegration of a recommendation module in an agent-based transportation\ntransactions management system. The module is built according to a novel hybrid\nrecommendation technique, which combines the advantages of collaborative\nfiltering and knowledge-based approaches. The proposed technique and supporting\nmodule assist customers in considering in detail alternative transportation\ntransactions that satisfy their requests, as well as in evaluating completed\ntransactions. The related services are invoked through a software agent that\nconstructs the appropriate knowledge rules and performs a synthesis of the\nrecommendation policy."}
{"summary":"Context as the dynamic information describing the situation of items and\nusers and affecting the users decision process is essential to be used by\nrecommender systems in mobile commerce to guarantee the quality of\nrecommendation. This paper proposes a novel multidimensional approach for\ncontext aware recommendation in mobile commerce. The approach represents users,\nitems, context information and the relationship between them in a\nmultidimensional space. It then determines the usage patterns of each user\nunder different contextual situations and creates a new 2 dimensional\nrecommendation space and does the final recommendation in that space. This\npaper also represents an evaluation process by implementing the proposed\napproach in a restaurant food recommendation system considering day, time,\nweather and companion as the contextual information and comparing the approach\nwith the traditional 2 dimensional one. The results of comparison illustrates\nthat the multidimensional approach increases the recommendation quality."}
{"summary":"Recommender systems have emerged as a new weapon to help online firms to\nrealize many of their strategic goals (e.g., to improve sales, revenue,\ncustomer experience etc.). However, many existing techniques commonly approach\nthese goals by seeking to recover preference (e.g., estimating ratings) in a\nmatrix completion framework. This paper aims to bridge this significant gap\nbetween the clearly-defined strategic objectives and the not-so-well-justified\nproxy.\n  We show it is advantageous to think of a recommender system as an analogy to\na monopoly economic market with the system as the sole seller, users as the\nbuyers and items as the goods. This new perspective motivates a game-theoretic\nformulation for recommendation that enables us to identify the optimal\nrecommendation policy by explicit optimizing certain strategic goals. In this\npaper, we revisit and extend our prior work, the Collaborative-Competitive\nFiltering preference model, towards a game-theoretic framework. The proposed\nframework consists of two components. First, a conditional preference model\nthat characterizes how a user would respond to a recommendation action; Second,\nknowing in advance how the user would respond, how a recommender system should\nact (i.e., recommend) strategically to maximize its goals. We show how\nobjectives such as click-through rate, sales revenue and consumption diversity\ncan be optimized explicitly in this framework. Experiments are conducted on a\ncommercial recommender system and demonstrate promising results."}
{"summary":"Weighted graphs obtained from co-occurrence in user-item relations lead to\nnon-metric topologies. We use this semi-metric behavior to issue\nrecommendations, and discuss its relationship to transitive closure on fuzzy\ngraphs. Finally, we test the performance of this method against other item- and\nuser-based recommender systems on the Movielens benchmark. We show that\nincluding highly semi-metric edges in our recommendation algorithms leads to\nbetter recommendations."}
{"summary":"Many businesses are using recommender systems for marketing outreach.\nRecommendation algorithms can be either based on content or driven by\ncollaborative filtering.

{"summary":"The success of \"infinite-inventory\" retailers such as Amazon.com and Netflix\nhas been largely attributed to a \"long tail\" phenomenon. Although the majority\nof their inventory is not in high demand, these niche products, unavailable at\nlimited-inventory competitors, generate a significant fraction of total revenue\nin aggregate. In addition, tail product availability can boost head sales by\noffering consumers the convenience of \"one-stop shopping\" for both their\nmainstream and niche tastes. However, most of existing recommender systems,\nespecially collaborative filter based methods, can not recommend tail products\ndue to the data sparsity issue. It has been widely acknowledged that to\nrecommend popular products is easier yet more trivial while to recommend long\ntail products adds more novelty yet it is also a more challenging task. In this\npaper, we propose a novel suite of graph-based algorithms for the long tail\nrecommendation. We first represent user-item information with undirected\nedge-weighted graph and investigate the theoretical foundation of applying\nHitting Time algorithm for long tail item recommendation. To improve\nrecommendation diversity and accuracy, we extend Hitting Time and propose\nefficient Absorbing Time algorithm to help users find their favorite long tail\nitems. Finally, we refine the Absorbing Time algorithm and propose two\nentropy-biased Absorbing Cost algorithms to distinguish the variation on\ndifferent user-item rating pairs, which further enhances the effectiveness of\nlong tail recommendation. Empirical experiments on two real life datasets show\nthat our proposed algorithms are effective to recommend long tail items and\noutperform state-of-the-art recommendation techniques."}
{"summary":"Recommender systems attempt to reduce information overload and retain\ncustomers by selecting a subset of items from a universal set based on user\npreferences. While research in recommender systems grew out of information\nretrieval and filtering, the topic has steadily advanced into a legitimate and\nchallenging research area of its own. Recommender systems have traditionally\nbeen studied from a content-based filtering vs. collaborative design\nperspective. Recommendations, however, are not delivered within a vacuum, but\nrather cast within an informal community of users and social context.\nTherefore, ultimately all recommender systems make connections among people and\nthus should be surveyed from such a perspective. This viewpoint is\nunder-emphasized in the recommender systems literature. We therefore take a\nconnection-oriented viewpoint toward recommender systems research. We posit\nthat recommendation has an inherently social element and is ultimately intended\nto connect people either directly as a result of explicit user modeling or\nindirectly through the discovery of relationships implicit in extant data.\nThus, recommender systems are characterized by how they model users to bring\npeople together: explicitly or implicitly. Finally, user modeling and the\nconnection-centric viewpoint raise broadening and social issues--such as\nevaluation, targeting, and privacy and trust--which we also briefly address."}
{"summary":"Recommender systems learn about user preferences over time, automatically\nfinding things of similar interest. This reduces the burden of creating\nexplicit queries. Recommender systems do, however, suffer from cold-start\nproblems where no initial information is available early on upon which to base\nrecommendations. Semantic knowledge structures, such as ontologies, can provide\nvaluable domain knowledge and user information. However, acquiring such\nknowledge and keeping it up to date is not a trivial task and user interests\nare particularly difficult to acquire and maintain. This paper investigates the\nsynergy between a web-based research paper recommender system and an ontology\ncontaining information automatically extracted from departmental databases\navailable on the web. The ontology is used to address the recommender systems\ncold-start problem. The recommender system addresses the ontology's\ninterest-acquisition problem. An empirical evaluation of this approach is\nconducted and the performance of the integrated systems measured."}
{"summary":"Recommender systems are emerging technologies that nowadays can be found in\nmany applications such as Amazon, Netflix, and so on. These systems help users\nto find relevant information, recommendations, and their preferred items.\nSlightly improvement of the accuracy of these recommenders can highly affect\nthe quality of recommendations. Matrix Factorization is a popular method in\nRecommendation Systems showing promising results in accuracy and complexity. In\nthis paper we propose an extension of matrix factorization which adds general\nneighborhood information on the recommendation model. Users and items are\nclustered into different categories to see how these categories share\npreferences. We then employ these shared interests of categories in a fusion by\nBiased Matrix Factorization to achieve more accurate recommendations. This is a\ncomplement for the current neighborhood aware matrix factorization models which\nrely on using direct neighborhood information of users and items. The proposed\nmodel is tested on two well-known recommendation system datasets: Movielens100k\nand Netflix. Our experiment shows applying the general latent features of\ncategories into factorized recommender models improves the accuracy of\nrecommendations. The current neighborhood-aware models need a great number of\nneighbors to acheive good accuracies. To the best of our knowledge, the\nproposed model is better than or comparable with the current neighborhood-aware\nmodels when they consider fewer number of neighbors."}

In this research, we propose\na new collaborative filtering model to improve user recommendations in\nreciprocal and bipartite social networks. The model considers a user's \"taste\"\nin picking others and \"attractiveness\" in being picked by others. A case study\nof an online dating network shows that the new model has good performance in\nrecommending both initial and reciprocal contacts."}
{"summary":"Traditionally, recommender systems for the Web deal with applications that\nhave two dimensions, users and items. Based on access logs that relate these\ndimensions, a recommendation model can be built and used to identify a set of N\nitems that will be of interest to a certain user. In this paper we propose a\nmethod to complement the information in the access logs with contextual\ninformation without changing the recommendation algorithm. The method consists\nin representing context as virtual items. We empirically test this method with\ntwo top-N recommender systems, an item-based collaborative filtering technique\nand association rules, on three data sets. The results show that our method is\nable to take advantage of the context (new dimensions) when it is informative."}
{"summary":"With the rapid growth of the Internet and overwhelming amount of information\nand choices that people are confronted with, recommender systems have been\ndeveloped to effectively support users' decision-making process in the online\nsystems. However, many recommendation algorithms suffer from the data sparsity\nproblem, i.e. the user-object bipartite networks are so sparse that algorithms\ncannot accurately recommend objects for users. This data sparsity problem makes\nmany well-known recommendation algorithms perform poorly. To solve the problem,\nwe propose a recommendation algorithm based on the semi-local diffusion process\non a user-object bipartite network. The numerical simulation on two sparse\ndatasets, Amazon and Bookcross, show that our method significantly outperforms\nthe state-of-the-art methods especially for those small-degree users. Two\npersonalized semi-local diffusion methods are proposed which further improve\nthe recommendation accuracy. Finally, our work indicates that sparse online\nsystems are essentially different from the dense online systems, all the\nalgorithms and conclusions based on dense data should be rechecked again in\nsparse data."}
{"summary":"The recommender system is one of the most promising ways to address the\ninformation overload problem in online systems. Based on the personal\nhistorical record, the recommender system can find interesting and relevant\nobjects for the user within a huge information space. Many physical processes\nsuch as the mass diffusion and heat conduction have been applied to design the\nrecommendation algorithms. The hybridization of these two algorithms has been\nshown to provide both accurate and diverse recommendation results. In this\npaper, we proposed two similarity preferential diffusion processes. Extensive\nexperimental analyses on two benchmark data sets demonstrate that both\nrecommendation and accuracy and diversity are improved duet to the similarity\npreference in the diffusion. The hybridization of the similarity preferential\ndiffusion processes is shown to significantly outperform the state-of-art\nrecommendation algorithm. Finally, our analysis on network sparsity show that\nthere is significant difference between dense and sparse system, indicating\nthat all the former conclusions on recommendation in the literature should be\nreexamined in sparse system."}
{"summary":"Users of online dating sites are facing information overload that requires\nthem to manually construct queries and browse huge amount of matching user\nprofiles.

In this\npaper we describe a recommender system we implemented and perform a\nquantitative comparison of two collaborative filtering (CF) and two global\nalgorithms. Results show that collaborative filtering recommenders\nsignificantly outperform global algorithms that are currently used by dating\nsites. A blind experiment with real users also confirmed that users prefer CF\nbased recommendations to global popularity recommendations.

{"summary":"In this paper, we propose an approach to analyze the performance and the\nadded value of automatic recommender systems in an industrial context. We show\nthat recommender systems are multifaceted and can be organized around 4\nstructuring functions: help users to decide, help users to compare, help users\nto discover, help users to explore. A global off line protocol is then proposed\nto evaluate recommender systems. This protocol is based on the definition of\nappropriate evaluation measures for each aforementioned function. The\nevaluation protocol is discussed from the perspective of the usefulness and\ntrust of the recommendation. A new measure called Average Measure of Impact is\nintroduced. This measure evaluates the impact of the personalized\nrecommendation. We experiment with two classical methods, K-Nearest Neighbors\n(KNN) and Matrix Factorization (MF), using the well known dataset: Netflix. A\nsegmentation of both users and items is proposed to finely analyze where the\nalgorithms perform well or badly. We show that the performance is strongly\ndependent on the segments and that there is no clear correlation between the\nRMSE and the quality of the recommendation."}
{"summary":"In this paper, we present a mathematical model to capture various factors\nwhich may influence the accuracy of a competitive group recommendation system.\nWe apply this model to peer review systems, i.e., conference or research grants\nreview, which is an essential component in our scientific community. We explore\nnumber of important questions, i.e., how will the number of reviews per paper\naffect the accuracy of the overall recommendation? Will the score aggregation\npolicy influence the final recommendation? How reviewers' preference may affect\nthe accuracy of the final recommendation? To answer these important questions,\nwe formally analyze our model. Through this analysis, we obtain the insight on\nhow to design a randomized algorithm which is both computationally efficient\nand asymptotically accurate in evaluating the accuracy of a competitive group\nrecommendation system. We obtain number of interesting observations: i.e., for\na medium tier conference, three reviews per paper is sufficient for a high\naccuracy recommendation. For prestigious conferences, one may need at least\nseven reviews per paper to achieve high accuracy. We also propose a\nheterogeneous review strategy which requires equal or less reviewing workload,\nbut can improve over a homogeneous review strategy in recommendation accuracy\nby as much as 30% . We believe our models and methodology are important\nbuilding blocks to study competitive group recommendation systems."}
{"summary":"Recommendation systems have received considerable attention in the recent\ndecades. Yet with the development of information technology and social media,\nthe risk in revealing private data to service providers has been a growing\nconcern to more and more users. Trade-offs between quality and privacy in\nrecommendation systems naturally arise. In this paper, we present a privacy\npreserving recommendation framework based on groups. The main idea is to use\ngroups as a natural middleware to preserve users' privacy. A distributed\npreference exchange algorithm is proposed to ensure the anonymity of data,\nwherein the effective size of the anonymity set asymptotically approaches the\ngroup size with time. We construct a hybrid collaborative filtering model based\non Markov random walks to provide recommendations and predictions to group\nmembers. Experimental results on the MovieLens and Epinions datasets show that\nour proposed methods outperform the baseline methods, L+ and ItemRank, two\nstate-of-the-art personalized recommendation algorithms, for both\nrecommendation precision and hit rate despite the absence of personal\npreference information."}

{"summary":"In this paper, we introduce a novel situation aware approach to improve a\ncontext based recommender system. To build situation aware user profiles, we\nrely on evidence issued from retrieval situations. A retrieval situation refers\nto the social spatio temporal context of the user when he interacts with the\nrecommender system. A situation is represented as a combination of social\nspatio temporal concepts inferred from ontological knowledge given social\ngroup, location and time information. User's interests are inferred from past\nuser's interaction with the recommender system related to the identified\nsituations. They are represented using concepts issued from a domain ontology.\nWe also propose a method to dynamically adapt the system to the user's\ninterest\\'\\s evolution."}
{"summary":"Most news recommender systems try to identify users' interests and news'\nattributes and use them to obtain recommendations. Here we propose an adaptive\nmodel which combines similarities in users' rating patterns with epidemic-like\nspreading of news on an evolving network. We study the model by computer\nagent-based simulations, measure its performance and discuss its robustness\nagainst bias and malicious behavior. Subject to the approval fraction of news\nrecommended, the proposed model outperforms the widely adopted recommendation\nof news according to their absolute or relative popularity. This model provides\na general social mechanism for recommender systems and may find its\napplications also in other types of recommendation."}
{"summary":"Recommender systems have shown great potential to address information\noverload problem, namely to help users in finding interesting and relevant\nobjects within a huge information space. Some physical dynamics, including heat\nconduction process and mass or energy diffusion on networks, have recently\nfound applications in personalized recommendation. Most of the previous studies\nfocus overwhelmingly on recommendation accuracy as the only important factor,\nwhile overlook the significance of diversity and novelty which indeed provide\nthe vitality of the system. In this paper, we propose a recommendation\nalgorithm based on the preferential diffusion process on user-object bipartite\nnetwork. Numerical analyses on two benchmark datasets, MovieLens and Netflix,\nindicate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.\nSpecifically, it can not only provide more accurate recommendations, but also\ngenerate more diverse and novel recommendations by accurately recommending\nunpopular objects."}
{"summary":"Recommender systems require their recommendation algorithms to be accurate,\nscalable and should handle very sparse training data which keep changing over\ntime. Inspired by ant colony optimization, we propose a novel collaborative\nfiltering scheme: Ant Collaborative Filtering that enjoys those favorable\ncharacteristics above mentioned. With the mechanism of pheromone transmission\nbetween users and items, our method can pinpoint most relative users and items\neven in face of the sparsity problem. By virtue of the evaporation of existing\npheromone, we capture the evolution of user preference over time. Meanwhile,\nthe computation complexity is comparatively small and the incremental update\ncan be done online. We design three experiments on three typical recommender\nsystems, namely movie recommendation, book recommendation and music\nrecommendation, which cover both explicit and implicit rating data. The results\nshow that the proposed algorithm is well suited for real-world recommendation\nscenarios which have a high throughput and are time sensitive."}
{"summary":"Recommender systems leverage product and community information to target\nproducts to consumers. Researchers have developed collaborative recommenders,\ncontent-based recommenders, and (largely ad-hoc) hybrid systems. We propose a\nunified probabilistic framework for merging collaborative and content-based\nrecommendations. We extend Hofmann's [1999] aspect model to incorporate\nthree-way co-occurrence data among users, items, and item content. The relative\ninfluence of collaboration data versus content data is not imposed as an\nexogenous parameter, but rather emerges naturally from the given data sources.\nGlobal probabilistic models coupled with standard Expectation Maximization (EM)\nlearning algorithms tend to drastically overfit in sparse-data situations, as\nis typical in recommendation applications. We show that secondary content\ninformation can often be used to overcome sparsity. Experiments on data from\nthe ResearchIndex library of Computer Science publications show that\nappropriate mixture models incorporating secondary data produce significantly\nbetter quality recommenders than k-nearest neighbors (k-NN). Global\nprobabilistic models also allow more general inferences than local methods like\nk-NN."}
{"summary":"Recommender systems associated with social networks often use social\nexplanations (e.g. \"X, Y and 2 friends like this\") to support the\nrecommendations. We present a study of the effects of these social explanations\nin a music recommendation context. We start with an experiment with 237 users,\nin which we show explanations with varying levels of social information and\nanalyze their effect on users' decisions. We distinguish between two key\ndecisions: the likelihood of checking out the recommended artist, and the\nactual rating of the artist based on listening to several songs. We find that\nwhile the explanations do have some influence on the likelihood, there is\nlittle correlation between the likelihood and actual (listening) rating for the\nsame artist. Based on these insights, we present a generative probabilistic\nmodel that explains the interplay between explanations and background\ninformation on music preferences, and how that leads to a final likelihood\nrating for an artist. Acknowledging the impact of explanations, we discuss a\ngeneral recommendation framework that models external informational elements in\nthe recommendation interface, in addition to inherent preferences of users."}
{"summary":"Two main approaches to using social network information in recommendation\nhave emerged: augmenting collaborative filtering with social data and\nalgorithms that use only ego-centric data. We compare the two approaches using\nmovie and music data from Facebook, and hashtag data from Twitter. We find that\nrecommendation algorithms based only on friends perform no worse than those\nbased on the full network, even though they require much less data and\ncomputational resources. Further, our evidence suggests that locality of\npreference, or the non-random distribution of item preferences in a social\nnetwork, is a driving force behind the value of incorporating social network\ninformation into recommender algorithms. When locality is high, as in Twitter\ndata, simple k-nn recommenders do better based only on friends than they do if\nthey draw from the entire network. These results help us understand when, and\nwhy, social network information is likely to support recommendation systems,\nand show that systems that see ego-centric slices of a complete network (such\nas websites that use Facebook logins) or have computational limitations (such\nas mobile devices) may profitably use ego-centric recommendation algorithms."}
{"summary":"Recently, collaborative tagging systems have attracted more and more\nattention and have been widely applied in web systems. Tags provide highly\nabstracted information about personal preferences and item content, and are\ntherefore potential to help in improving better personalized recommendations.\nIn this paper, we propose a tag-based recommendation algorithm considering the\npersonal vocabulary and evaluate it in a real-world dataset: Del.icio.us.\nExperimental results demonstrate that the usage of tag information can\nsignificantly improve the accuracy of personalized recommendations."}
{"summary":"Most existing approaches in Context-Aware Recommender Systems (CRS) focus on\nrecommending relevant items to users taking into account contextual\ninformation, such as time, location, or social aspects. However, few of them\nhave considered the problem of user's content dynamicity. We introduce in this\npaper an algorithm that tackles the user's content dynamicity by modeling the\nCRS as a contextual bandit algorithm and by including a situation clustering\nalgorithm to improve the precision of the CRS. Within a deliberately designed\noffline simulation framework, we conduct evaluations with real online event log\ndata. The experimental results and detailed analysis reveal several important\ndiscoveries in context aware recommender system."}
{"summary":"As the growing interest of web recommendation systems those are applied to\ndeliver customized data for their users, we started working on this system.\nGenerally the recommendation systems are divided into two major categories such\nas collaborative recommendation system and content based recommendation system.\nIn case of collaborative recommen-dation systems, these try to seek out users\nwho share same tastes that of given user as well as recommends the websites\naccording to the liking given user. Whereas the content based recommendation\nsystems tries to recommend web sites similar to those web sites the user has\nliked. In the recent research we found that the efficient technique based on\nasso-ciation rule mining algorithm is proposed in order to solve the problem of\nweb page recommendation. Major problem of the same is that the web pages are\ngiven equal importance. Here the importance of pages changes according to the\nfre-quency of visiting the web page as well as amount of time user spends on\nthat page. Also recommendation of newly added web pages or the pages those are\nnot yet visited by users are not included in the recommendation set. To\nover-come this problem, we have used the web usage log in the adaptive\nassociation rule based web mining where the asso-ciation rules were applied to\npersonalization. This algorithm was purely based on the Apriori data mining\nalgorithm in order to generate the association rules. However this method also\nsuffers from some unavoidable drawbacks. In this paper we are presenting and\ninvestigating the new approach based on weighted Association Rule Mining\nAlgorithm and text mining. This is improved algorithm which adds semantic\nknowledge to the results, has more efficiency and hence gives better quality\nand performances as compared to existing approaches."}
{"summary":"The advent of the Semantic Web necessitates paradigm shifts away from\ncentralized client/server architectures towards decentralization and\npeer-to-peer computation, making the existence of central authorities\nsuperfluous and even impossible. At the same time, recommender systems are\ngaining considerable impact in e-commerce, providing people with\nrecommendations that are personalized and tailored to their very needs. These\nrecommender systems have traditionally been deployed with stark centralized\nscenarios in mind, operating in closed communities detached from their host\nnetwork's outer perimeter. We aim at marrying these two worlds, i.e.,\ndecentralized peer-to-peer computing and recommender systems, in one\nagent-based framework. Our architecture features an epidemic-style protocol\nmaintaining neighborhoods of like-minded peers in a robust, selforganizing\nfashion. In order to demonstrate our architecture's ability to retain\nscalability, robustness and to allow for convergence towards high-quality\nrecommendations, we conduct offline experiments on top of the popular MovieLens\ndataset."}
{"summary":"Recommender systems engage user profiles and appropriate filtering techniques\nto assist users in finding more relevant information over the large volume of\ninformation. User profiles play an important role in the success of\nrecommendation process since they model and represent the actual user needs.\nHowever, a comprehensive literature review of recommender systems has\ndemonstrated no concrete study on the role and impact of knowledge in user\nprofiling and filtering approache. In this paper, we review the most prominent\nrecommender systems in the literature and examine the impression of knowledge\nextracted from different sources. We then come up with this finding that\nsemantic information from the user context has substantial impact on the\nperformance of knowledge based recommender systems. Finally, some new clues for\nimprovement the knowledge-based profiles have been proposed."}
{"summary":"The ongoing rapid expansion of the Internet greatly increases the necessity\nof effective recommender systems for filtering the abundant information.\nExtensive research for recommender systems is conducted by a broad range of\ncommunities including social and computer scientists, physicists, and\ninterdisciplinary researchers. Despite substantial theoretical and practical\nachievements, unification and comparison of different approaches are lacking,\nwhich impedes further advances. In this article, we review recent developments\nin recommender systems and discuss the major challenges. We compare and\nevaluate available algorithms and examine their roles in the future\ndevelopments. In addition to algorithms, physical aspects are described to\nillustrate macroscopic behavior of recommender systems. Potential impacts and\nfuture directions are discussed. We emphasize that recommendation has a great\nscientific depth and combines diverse research fields which makes it of\ninterests for physicists as well as interdisciplinary researchers."}
{"summary":"Ubiquitous information access becomes more and more important nowadays and\nresearch is aimed at making it adapted to users. Our work consists in applying\nmachine learning techniques in order to bring a solution to some of the\nproblems concerning the acceptance of the system by users. To achieve this, we\npropose a fundamental shift in terms of how we model the learning of\nrecommender system: inspired by models of human reasoning developed in robotic,\nwe combine reinforcement learning and case-base reasoning to define a\nrecommendation process that uses these two approaches for generating\nrecommendations on different context dimensions (social, temporal, geographic).\nWe describe an implementation of the recommender system based on this\nframework. We also present preliminary results from experiments with the system\nand show how our approach increases the recommendation quality."}
{"summary":"In this paper, we propose a new approach for recommender systems based on\ntarget tracking by Kalman filtering. We assume that users and their seen\nresources are vectors in the multidimensional space of the categories of the\nresources. Knowing this space, we propose an algorithm based on a Kalman filter\nto track users and to predict the best prediction of their future position in\nthe recommendation space."}
{"summary":"Recommender systems recommend objects regardless of potential adverse effects\nof their overcrowding. We address this shortcoming by introducing\ncrowd-avoiding recommendation where each object can be shared by only a limited\nnumber of users or where object utility diminishes with the number of users\nsharing it. We use real data to show that contrary to expectations, the\nintroduction of these constraints enhances recommendation accuracy and\ndiversity even in systems where overcrowding is not detrimental. The observed\naccuracy improvements are explained in terms of removing potential bias of the\nrecommendation method. We finally propose a way to model artificial\nsocio-economic systems with crowd avoidance and obtain first analytical\nresults."}
{"summary":"This paper presents a Multi-Agent approach to the problem of recommending\ntraining courses to engineering professionals. The recommendation system is\nbuilt as a proof of concept and limited to the electrical and mechanical\nengineering disciplines. Through user modelling and data collection from a\nsurvey, collaborative filtering recommendation is implemented using intelligent\nagents. The agents work together in recommending meaningful training courses\nand updating the course information. The system uses a users profile and\nkeywords from courses to rank courses. A ranking accuracy for courses of 90% is\nachieved while flexibility is achieved using an agent that retrieves\ninformation autonomously using data mining techniques from websites. This\nmanner of recommendation is scalable and adaptable. Further improvements can be\nmade using clustering and recording user feedback."}
