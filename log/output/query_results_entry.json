We formulate the\nrecommendation problem as an inference problem and aim to compute the marginal\nprobability distributions of the variables which represent the ratings to be\npredicted. However, computing these marginal probability functions is\ncomputationally prohibitive for large-scale systems. Therefore, we utilize the\nBP algorithm to efficiently compute these functions. Recommendations for each\nactive user are then iteratively computed by probabilistic message passing. As\nopposed to the previous recommender algorithms, BPRS does not require solving\nthe recommendation problem for all the users if it wishes to update the\nrecommendations for only a single active. Further, BPRS computes the\nrecommendations for each user with linear complexity and without requiring a\ntraining period. Via computer simulations (using the 100K MovieLens dataset),\nwe verify that BPRS iteratively reduces the error in the predicted ratings of\nthe users until it converges. Finally, we confirm that BPRS is comparable to\nthe state of art methods such as Correlation-based neighborhood model (CorNgbr)\nand Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) in terms of rating and precision\naccuracy. Therefore, we believe that the BP-based recommendation algorithm is a\nnew promising approach which offers a significant advantage on scalability\nwhile providing competitive accuracy for the recommender systems.","published":"2012-09-24T16:59:12Z","updated":"2012-09-24T16:59:12Z"}}

To learn user preferences, it uses a Bayesian model, which\naccounts for both audio content and the novelty of recommendations. A\npiecewise-linear approximation to the model and a variational inference\nalgorithm are employed to speed up Bayesian inference.

However, many existing techniques commonly approach\nthese goals by seeking to recover preference (e.g., estimating ratings) in a\nmatrix completion framework. This paper aims to bridge this significant gap\nbetween the clearly-defined strategic objectives and the not-so-well-justified\nproxy.\n  We show it is advantageous to think of a recommender system as an analogy to\na monopoly economic market with the system as the sole seller, users as the\nbuyers and items as the goods. This new perspective motivates a game-theoretic\nformulation for recommendation that enables us to identify the optimal\nrecommendation policy by explicit optimizing certain strategic goals. In this\npaper, we revisit and extend our prior work, the Collaborative-Competitive\nFiltering preference model, towards a game-theoretic framework. The proposed\nframework consists of two components. First, a conditional preference model\nthat characterizes how a user would respond to a recommendation action; Second,\nknowing in advance how the user would respond, how a recommender system should\nact (i.e., recommend) strategically to maximize its goals.

Although the majority\nof their inventory is not in high demand, these niche products, unavailable at\nlimited-inventory competitors, generate a significant fraction of total revenue\nin aggregate. In addition, tail product availability can boost head sales by\noffering consumers the convenience of \"one-stop shopping\" for both their\nmainstream and niche tastes. However, most of existing recommender systems,\nespecially collaborative filter based methods, can not recommend tail products\ndue to the data sparsity issue. It has been widely acknowledged that to\nrecommend popular products is easier yet more trivial while to recommend long\ntail products adds more novelty yet it is also a more challenging task. In this\npaper, we propose a novel suite of graph-based algorithms for the long tail\nrecommendation. We first represent user-item information with undirected\nedge-weighted graph and investigate the theoretical foundation of applying\nHitting Time algorithm for long tail item recommendation. To improve\nrecommendation diversity and accuracy, we extend Hitting Time and propose\nefficient Absorbing Time algorithm to help users find their favorite long tail\nitems. Finally, we refine the Absorbing Time algorithm and propose two\nentropy-biased Absorbing Cost algorithms to distinguish the variation on\ndifferent user-item rating pairs, which further enhances the effectiveness of\nlong tail recommendation.

When locality is high, as in Twitter\ndata, simple k-nn recommenders do better based only on friends than they do if\nthey draw from the entire network. These results help us understand when, and\nwhy, social network information is likely to support recommendation systems,\nand show that systems that see ego-centric slices of a complete network (such\nas websites that use Facebook logins) or have computational limitations (such\nas mobile devices) may profitably use ego-centric recommendation algorithms.","published":"2013-04-17T14:26:59Z","updated":"2013-04-17T14:26:59Z"}}

Whereas the content based recommendation\nsystems tries to recommend web sites similar to those web sites the user has\nliked. In the recent research we found that the efficient technique based on\nasso-ciation rule mining algorithm is proposed in order to solve the problem of\nweb page recommendation. Major problem of the same is that the web pages are\ngiven equal importance. Here the importance of pages changes according to the\nfre-quency of visiting the web page as well as amount of time user spends on\nthat page. Also recommendation of newly added web pages or the pages those are\nnot yet visited by users are not included in the recommendation set. To\nover-come this problem, we have used the web usage log in the adaptive\nassociation rule based web mining where the asso-ciation rules were applied to\npersonalization. This algorithm was purely based on the Apriori data mining\nalgorithm in order to generate the association rules. However this method also\nsuffers from some unavoidable drawbacks. In this paper we are presenting and\ninvestigating the new approach based on weighted Association Rule Mining\nAlgorithm and text mining. This is improved algorithm which adds semantic\nknowledge to the results, has more efficiency and hence gives better quality\nand performances as compared to existing approaches.","published":"2013-11-28T04:22:55Z","updated":"2013-11-28T04:22:55Z"}}
