       <h3>War Crimes Avoidance & Detection: Battlefield Management Systems</h3>

In today's world, almost any armed conflict involving national military forces or non-state actors,results in allegations of war crimes and calls for investigations and prosecutions. As continuedpenetration of the Internet in the society leads to ever more thorough scrutiny of military operations,the world's military forces are in a continuous struggle for situational awareness via their own networkcentric Battlefield Management Systems(BMS). But in many publications on the subject matter, little attention is paid as pertains to improving the humanitarian conditions in the Battle-space. The focus for the moment seems to be geared towards the attainment of tactical military objectives, by conducting
military operations against, seemingly virtual adversaries. Pragmatically speaking 'claiming that  a war can be conducted without atrocities, is akin to claiming that a market can be free from fraud'.

       <h3>Introduction to Neutrosophic Measure, Neutrosophic Integral, and Neutrosophic Probability</h3>

       <p><b>Authors:</b> <a href="/author/florentin_smarandache">Florentin Smarandache</a><br/>
          <small><b>Comments:</b> 140 Pages. Keywords: Neutrosophics, Neutrosophic Measure, Neutrosophic Integral, Neutrosophic Probability, Neutrosophic Logic, Neutrosophic Set, Neutrosophy.</small></p>

       <p>
In this book, we introduce for the first time the notions of neutrosophic measure and neutrosophic integral, and we develop the 1995 notion of neutrosophic probability. We present many practical examples.
It is possible to define the neutrosophic measure and consequently the neutrosophic integral and neutrosophic probability in many ways, because there are various types of indeterminacies, depending on the problem we need to solve. Neutrosophics study the indeterminacy. Indeterminacy is different from randomness. It can be caused by physical space materials and type of construction, by items involved in the space, etc.

We show herein:
- How Extenics is connected to the 3-Valued Neutrosophic Logic,
- How Extenics is connected to the 4-Valued Neutrosophic Logic,
- How Extenics is connected to the n-Valued Neutrosophic Logic,
when contradictions occurs.

neutrosophic soft set to rings theory .The notion of intuitionistic neutrosophic soft rings is
introduced and their basic properties are presented . Intersection, union, AND, and OR
operations of intuitionistic neutrosophic soft rings are defined . Also ,we have defined the

an effective mathematical tool to deal with uncertainties. In this paper new operations on intuitionistic neutrosophic soft sets
have been introduced . Some results relating to the properties of these operations have been established. Moreover ,we
illustrate their interconnections between each other.

Smarandache (1995) defined the notion of neutrosophic sets, which is a generalization of Zadeh's fuzzy set and Atanassov's
intuitionistic fuzzy set. In this paper, we first develop some similarity measures of neutrosophic sets. We will present a method to calculate the
distance between neutrosophic sets (NS) on the basis of the Hausdorff distance. Then we will use this distance to generate a new similarity
measure to calculate the degree of similarity between NS. Finally we will prove some properties of the proposed similarity measures.

Quality in primary education has been classified into five factors involving learners, content,
processes, environment and outcomes. In this paper we analyzed, quality in primary education in
Chennai and find out its solution using Neutrosophic cognitive maps (NCMS), which is the
generalization of fuzzy cognitive maps (FCMS) defined by W.B. Vasantha Kandasamy and Florentine
Smarandache. This paper has five sections. First section gives information about development of fuzzy
cognitive maps and Neutrosophic cognitive maps. Second section gives the preliminaries of FCMS
and NCMS. In section three, we give the description of the problem; final section gives the conclusion
based on our study.

       <p>
We summarize the Storkey Learning Rules for the Hopfield Model, and evaluate performance relative to other learning rules. Hopfield Models are normally used for auto-association, and Storkey Learning Rules have been found to have good balance between local learning and capacity. In this paper we outline different learning rules and summarise capacity results. Hopfield networks are related to Boltzmann Machines: they are the same as fully visible Boltzmann Machines in the zero temperature limit. Perhaps renewed interest in Boltzmann machines will produce renewed interest in Hopfield learning rules?

Face recognition (FR) is a challenging task in biometrics due

In this paper, we study the linear distributed asymptotic consensus problem for a network of dynamic agents whose communication network is modeled by a randomly switching graph. A finite state Markov process dominates each topology corresponding to a state of the process. We address both the cases where the dynamics of the agents is expressed in continuous and discrete time. As long as the consensus matrices are doubly stochastic, convergence to average consensus can be shown to be achieved in the mean square and almost sure sense. A necessary and sufficient condition is the graph resulted from the union of graphs corresponding to the states of the Markov process contains a spanning tree.
