These foundations require that we first work out\na coherent theory of countable relatively hyperbolic groups (not necessarily\nfinitely generated). We prove the equivalence of Gromov, Osin, and Bowditch's\ndefinitions of relative hyperbolicity for countable groups.\n  We then give several equivalent definitions of relatively quasiconvex\nsubgroups in terms of various natural geometries on a relatively hyperbolic\ngroup. We show that each relatively quasiconvex subgroup is itself relatively\nhyperbolic, and that the intersection of two relatively quasiconvex subgroups\nis again relatively quasiconvex. In the finitely generated case, we prove that\nevery undistorted subgroup is relatively quasiconvex, and we compute the\ndistortion of a finitely generated relatively quasiconvex subgroup.",

The Lorentz boosts\nimply non-associative addition of ternary relative velocities. Within\nEinstein's special relativity theory, each preferred observer (fixed stars,\naether, etc), determine the unique relative velocity among each pair of massive\nbodies. Therefore, the special relativity founded on Minkowski's axiom, that\neach pair of reference systems must be related by Lorentz isometry, needs a\npreferred reference system in order to have the unique Einstein's relative\nvelocity among each pair of massive bodies. This choice-dependence of relative\nvelocity violate the Relativity Principle that all reference systems must be\nequivalent. This astonishing conflict of the Lorentz relativity group, with the\nRelativity Principle, can be resolved in two alternative ways. Either, abandon\nthe Relativity Principle in favor of a preferred reference system [de Abreu\n2004; de Abreu and Guerra 2005, 2006]. Or, within the Relativity Principle,\nreplace the Lorentz relativity group by the relativity groupoid, with the\nchoice-free binary relative velocities introduced by Minkowski in 1908. Binary\n- means that the relative velocity is a function of a pair of reference\nsystems. Following Minkowski [1908], we consider the binary relative velocity\nto be the Minkowski space-like vector (and not the Minkowski bivector as it is\nin the Hestenes theory [Hestenes 1974]).",
